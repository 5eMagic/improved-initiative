          <p>Shadow dragons are true dragons that were either born in the Shadowfell or transformed by years spent within its dismal confines. Some shadow dragons embrace the Shadowfell for its bleak landscapes and desolation.Others seek to return to the Material Plane, hungry to spread the darkness and evil of the Plane of Shadow.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dark Portals.</i>
            </b> Portals to the Shadowfell manifest in forlorn places and the deep gloom of subterranean caverns. The dragons that lair in such places often discover these portals and find themselves transported to a new realm. Ancient dragons that sleep in their lairs for months or years at a time might find themselves spirited away, never knowing that a portal has formed without their knowledge as they dream.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Recast in Shadow.</i>
            </b> The transformation to a shadow dragon happens over a period of years, during which time a dragon's scales lose their luster and fade to a charcoal hue. Its leathery wings become translucent, its eyes paling to pools of opalescent gray. Shadow dragons find sunlight abhorrent, and they are weaker in bright light than they are in darkness. Darkness makes thedragon fade to a spectral shadow of its former self.</p>
          <p>The magical nature of dragons holds an attraction for the Shadowfell, which seems somehow to crave the might and majesty of these great reptiles. The Shadowfell also has a dispiriting effect on its denizens, such that the longer a creature remains on the plane, the more it accepts the plane's malaise. As months and years pass for a dragon on the Shadowfell, it becomes aware of the transformation being wrought upon it, and yet can do nothing to prevent it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Back in the World.</i>
            </b> A shadow dragon is so suffused with the power of the Shadowfell that even a return tothe Material Plane can't undo its transformation. Some shadow dragons attempt to lure other creatures from the mortal realm back to the Shadowfell to keep them company, at least until they tire of their guests and devour them. Others are happy to leave the Shadowfell behind forever, understanding that treasure and powerare easier to come by in the Material Plane.</p>
          <h>Shadow Dragon Template</h>
          <p>Only a true dragon can transform into a shadow dragon, and only if it is born in the Shadowfell or remains there for several years. A dracolich can't be turned into a shadow dragon, since it loses its draconic nature when it becomes undead.</p>

          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_blackdragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Black Dragon</link>
          <p>The most evil-tempered and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.</p>
          <p>With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon's face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.</p>
          <p>When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Brutal and Cruel.</i>
            </b> All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.</p>
          <p>A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Foes and Servants.</i>
            </b> Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.</p>
          <p>Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons,raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food togive as tribute and building crude draconic effigies alongthe borders of their dragon master's domain.</p>
          <p>A black dragon's malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon's lair.</p>
          <p>Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipedebites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon's hunger.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Wealth of the Ancients.</i>
            </b> Black dragons hoard the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current civilizations for itself.</p>
          <h>A Black Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon's lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues.

          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, andsubservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>Black Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_blackdragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Black Dragon</link>
          <p>The most evil-tempered and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.</p>
          <p>With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon's face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.</p>
          <p>When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Brutal and Cruel.</i>
            </b> All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.</p>
          <p>A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Foes and Servants.</i>
            </b> Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.</p>
          <p>Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons,raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food togive as tribute and building crude draconic effigies alongthe borders of their dragon master's domain.</p>
          <p>A black dragon's malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon's lair.</p>
          <p>Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipedebites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon's hunger.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Wealth of the Ancients.</i>
            </b> Black dragons hoard the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current civilizations for itself.</p>
          <h>A Black Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon's lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>

            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>

When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>

          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them.

          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_blackdragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Black Dragon</link>
          <p>The most evil-tempered and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.</p>
          <p>With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon's face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.</p>
          <p>When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Brutal and Cruel.</i>
            </b> All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.</p>
          <p>A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Foes and Servants.</i>
            </b> Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.</p>
          <p>Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons,raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food togive as tribute and building crude draconic effigies alongthe borders of their dragon master's domain.</p>
          <p>A black dragon's malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon's lair.</p>
          <p>Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipedebites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon's hunger.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Wealth of the Ancients.</i>
            </b> Black dragons hoard the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current civilizations for itself.</p>
          <h>A Black Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon's lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.</li>
            <li>A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action,uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li>
            <li>Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary black dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.</li>
            <li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernat.urally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink suchwater regurgitate it within minutes.</li>
            <li>Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

              <i>Foes and Servants.</i>
            </b> Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.</p>
          <p>Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons,raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food togive as tribute and building crude draconic effigies alongthe borders of their dragon master's domain.</p>
          <p>A black dragon's malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon's lair.</p>
          <p>Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipedebites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon's hunger.</p>

            <b>
              <i>Wealth of the Ancients.</i>
            </b> Black dragons hoard the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current civilizations for itself.</p>
          <h>A Black Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon's lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.</li>
            <li>A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action,uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li>
            <li>Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary black dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.</li>
            <li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernat.urally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink suchwater regurgitate it within minutes.</li>
            <li>Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, andsubservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>Blue Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_bluedragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Blue Dragon</link>
          <p>Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert's reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Vain and Deadly.</i>
            </b> A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm's reach as it waits to attack again.</p>
          <p>Desert Predators. Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habitsmake blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.</p>
          <p>When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Overlords and Minions.</i>
            </b> Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.</p>
          <p>Hoarders of Gems. Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewellery and magic items adorned with those gems.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.</p>
          <h>A Blue Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowingability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnelsbeneath the sands.</p>
          <p>Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon's lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilatethe lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that</p>
          <p>are the dragon's first line of defense.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows</p>
          <p>out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated.</p>
          <p>When it returns later, it collects its possessions-along with the wealth of the dead intruders.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon</p>
          <p>takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.</li>
            <li>A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
            <li>Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.</li>
            <li>Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (-5).</li>
            <li>Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 + 10 feet into the sinkhole.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.</p>

          <h>Blue Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_bluedragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Blue Dragon</link>
          <p>Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert's reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Vain and Deadly.</i>
            </b> A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm's reach as it waits to attack again.</p>
          <p>Desert Predators. Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habitsmake blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.</p>
          <p>When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Overlords and Minions.</i>
            </b> Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.</p>
          <p>Hoarders of Gems. Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewellery and magic items adorned with those gems.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.</p>
          <h>A Blue Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowingability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnelsbeneath the sands.</p>
          <p>Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon's lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilatethe lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that</p>
          <p>are the dragon's first line of defense.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows</p>
          <p>out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated.</p>
          <p>When it returns later, it collects its possessions-along with the wealth of the dead intruders.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon</p>
          <p>takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.</li>
            <li>A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
            <li>Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.</li>
            <li>Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (-5).</li>
            <li>Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 + 10 feet into the sinkhole.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_bluedragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Blue Dragon</link>
          <p>Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert's reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Vain and Deadly.</i>
            </b> A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm's reach as it waits to attack again.</p>
          <p>Desert Predators. Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habitsmake blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.</p>
          <p>When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Overlords and Minions.</i>
            </b> Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.</p>
          <p>Hoarders of Gems. Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewellery and magic items adorned with those gems.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.</p>
          <h>A Blue Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowingability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnelsbeneath the sands.</p>
          <p>Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon's lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilatethe lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that</p>
          <p>are the dragon's first line of defense.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows</p>
          <p>out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated.</p>
          <p>When it returns later, it collects its possessions-along with the wealth of the dead intruders.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon</p>
          <p>takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.</li>
            <li>A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
            <li>Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.</li>
            <li>Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (-5).</li>
            <li>Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 + 10 feet into the sinkhole.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, andsubservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.</li>
            <li>Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (-5).</li>
            <li>Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 + 10 feet into the sinkhole.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, andsubservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>Green Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_greendragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Green Dragon</link>
          <p>The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subvertingand corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.</p>
          <p>A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.</p>
          <p>A wyrmling green dragon's thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.</p>
          <p>A green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Capricious Hunters.</i>
            </b> A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.</p>
          <p>Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.</p>
          <p>A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Manipulative Schemers.</i>
            </b> A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creatureis only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.</p>
          <p>When manipulating other creatures, green dragonsare honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Conflict and Corruption.</i>
            </b> Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watch-sometimes for decades-for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.</p>
          <p>Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions' tortured dreams.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Living Treasures.</i>
            </b> A green dragon's favored treasuresare the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.</p>
          <h>A Green Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath.</p>
          <p>The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a mazeinto the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.</p>
          <p>At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partlysubmerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragontakes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wallsinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 onthe next round.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary green dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Thickets form labyrinthine passages within1 mile of the dragon's lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets,with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns.</li>
            <p>Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.</p>
            <li>Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path.</li>
            <li>Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, andsubservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>Green Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_greendragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Green Dragon</link>
          <p>The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subvertingand corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.</p>
          <p>A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.</p>
          <p>A wyrmling green dragon's thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.</p>
          <p>A green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Capricious Hunters.</i>
            </b> A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.</p>
          <p>Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.</p>
          <p>A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Manipulative Schemers.</i>
            </b> A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creatureis only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.</p>
          <p>When manipulating other creatures, green dragonsare honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Conflict and Corruption.</i>
            </b> Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watch-sometimes for decades-for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.</p>
          <p>Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions' tortured dreams.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Living Treasures.</i>
            </b> A green dragon's favored treasuresare the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.</p>
          <h>A Green Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath.</p>
          <p>The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a mazeinto the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.</p>
          <p>At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partlysubmerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragontakes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wallsinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 onthe next round.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary green dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Thickets form labyrinthine passages within1 mile of the dragon's lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets,with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns.</li>
            <p>Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.</p>
            <li>Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path.</li>
            <li>Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests.

          <h>Green Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_greendragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Green Dragon</link>
          <p>The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subvertingand corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.</p>
          <p>A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.</p>
          <p>A wyrmling green dragon's thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.</p>
          <p>A green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Capricious Hunters.</i>
            </b> A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.</p>
          <p>Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.</p>
          <p>A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Manipulative Schemers.</i>
            </b> A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creatureis only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.</p>
          <p>When manipulating other creatures, green dragonsare honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Conflict and Corruption.</i>
            </b> Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watch-sometimes for decades-for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.</p>
          <p>Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions' tortured dreams.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Living Treasures.</i>
            </b> A green dragon's favored treasuresare the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.</p>
          <h>A Green Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath.</p>
          <p>The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a mazeinto the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.</p>
          <p>At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partlysubmerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragontakes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wallsinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 onthe next round.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary green dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Thickets form labyrinthine passages within1 mile of the dragon's lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets,with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns.</li>
            <p>Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.</p>
            <li>Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path.</li>
            <li>Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, andsubservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>

          <h>Green Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_greendragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Green Dragon</link>
          <p>The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subvertingand corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.</p>
          <p>A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.</p>
          <p>A wyrmling green dragon's thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.</p>
          <p>A green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Capricious Hunters.</i>
            </b> A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.</p>
          <p>Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.</p>
          <p>A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Manipulative Schemers.</i>
            </b> A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creatureis only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.</p>
          <p>When manipulating other creatures, green dragonsare honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Conflict and Corruption.</i>
            </b> Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watch-sometimes for decades-for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.</p>
          <p>Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions' tortured dreams.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Living Treasures.</i>
            </b> A green dragon's favored treasuresare the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.</p>
          <h>A Green Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath.</p>
          <p>The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a mazeinto the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.</p>
          <p>At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partlysubmerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragontakes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wallsinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 onthe next round.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary green dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Thickets form labyrinthine passages within1 mile of the dragon's lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets,with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns.</li>
            <p>Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.</p>
            <li>Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path.</li>
            <li>Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, andsubservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>Red Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_reddragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Red Dragon</link>
          <p>The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures. The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.</p>
          <p>The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Mountain Masters.</i>
            </b> Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hill-dwelling copper dragons from time to time.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Arrogant Tyrants.</i>
            </b> Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.</p>
          <p>No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Status and Slaves.</i>
            </b> Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.</p>
          <p>When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Obsessive Collectors.</i>
            </b> Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary.They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.</p>
          <p>A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact location.

          <h>A Red Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling incaverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards thathinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanicgases wash over a dragon as it sleeps. With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls-and the wider world it seeks to control.</p>
          <p>Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon's power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, tak.ing 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
            <li>A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
            <li>Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initia.tive count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary red dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of thedragon's lair.</li>
            <li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernatu.rally warm and tainted by sulfur.</li>
            <li>Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing crea. tures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.</li>

          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, andsubservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>Red Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_reddragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Red Dragon</link>
          <p>The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures. The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.</p>
          <p>The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Mountain Masters.</i>
            </b> Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hill-dwelling copper dragons from time to time.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Arrogant Tyrants.</i>
            </b> Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.</p>
          <p>No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Status and Slaves.</i>
            </b> Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.</p>
          <p>When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Obsessive Collectors.</i>
            </b> Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary.They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.</p>
          <p>A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can't be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.</p>

          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_reddragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Red Dragon</link>
          <p>The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures. The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.</p>
          <p>The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Mountain Masters.</i>
            </b> Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hill-dwelling copper dragons from time to time.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Arrogant Tyrants.</i>
            </b> Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.</p>
          <p>No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Status and Slaves.</i>
            </b> Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.</p>
          <p>When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Obsessive Collectors.</i>
            </b> Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary.They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.</p>
          <p>A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can't be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.</p>
          <h>A Red Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling incaverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards thathinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanicgases wash over a dragon as it sleeps. With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls-and the wider world it seeks to control.</p>
          <p>Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon's power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, tak.ing 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
            <li>A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
            <li>Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initia.tive count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary red dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of thedragon's lair.</li>
            <li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernatu.rally warm and tainted by sulfur.</li>
            <li>Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing crea. tures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

            </b> Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.</p>
          <p>No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Status and Slaves.</i>
            </b> Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.</p>
          <p>When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Obsessive Collectors.</i>
            </b> Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary.They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.</p>
          <p>A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can't be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.</p>
          <h>A Red Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling incaverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards thathinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanicgases wash over a dragon as it sleeps. With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls-and the wider world it seeks to control.</p>
          <p>Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon's power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, tak.ing 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
            <li>A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
            <li>Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initia.tive count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary red dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of thedragon's lair.</li>
            <li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernatu.rally warm and tainted by sulfur.</li>
            <li>Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing crea. tures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>White Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_whitedragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">White Dragon</link>
          <p>The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic ofthe chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.</p>
          <p>A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Primal and Vengeful.</i>
            </b> White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters amongall dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.</p>
          <p>A white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warningsto intruders.</p>
          <p>Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unlessmoved to do so.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Lone Masters.</i>
            </b> White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.</p>
          <p>White dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids thatdemonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.</p>
          <p>Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a whitedragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Treasure Under Ice.</i>
            </b> White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities,particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arcticclimes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bonesculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.</p>
          <p>Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikesthem. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.</p>
          <p>A white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature makingthe offer and seize the treasure on their own.</p>
          <h>A White Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.</p>
          <p>A legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon's presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.</p>
          <p>A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in itslair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair actionagain or until the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can seewithin 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li>
            <li>The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>

          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>White Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_whitedragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">White Dragon</link>
          <p>The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic ofthe chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.</p>
          <p>A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Primal and Vengeful.</i>
            </b> White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters amongall dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.</p>
          <p>A white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warningsto intruders.</p>
          <p>Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unlessmoved to do so.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Lone Masters.</i>
            </b> White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.</p>
          <p>White dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids thatdemonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.</p>
          <p>Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a whitedragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Treasure Under Ice.</i>
            </b> White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities,particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arcticclimes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bonesculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.</p>
          <p>Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikesthem. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.</p>
          <p>A white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature makingthe offer and seize the treasure on their own.</p>
          <h>A White Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.</p>
          <p>A legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon's presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.</p>
          <p>A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in itslair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair actionagain or until the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can seewithin 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li>
            <li>The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary white dragon's lairis warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.</li>
            <li>Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the drag.on's lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions whenthe dragon is at rest.</li>
            <li>Icy walls block off areas in the dragon's lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days.</p>

They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it.

When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing.

              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them.

          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_whitedragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">White Dragon</link>
          <p>The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic ofthe chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.</p>
          <p>A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Primal and Vengeful.</i>
            </b> White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters amongall dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.</p>
          <p>A white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warningsto intruders.</p>
          <p>Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unlessmoved to do so.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Lone Masters.</i>
            </b> White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.</p>
          <p>White dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids thatdemonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.</p>
          <p>Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a whitedragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Treasure Under Ice.</i>
            </b> White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities,particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arcticclimes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bonesculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.</p>
          <p>Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikesthem. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.</p>
          <p>A white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature makingthe offer and seize the treasure on their own.</p>
          <h>A White Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.</p>
          <p>A legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon's presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.</p>
          <p>A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in itslair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair actionagain or until the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can seewithin 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li>
            <li>The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary white dragon's lairis warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.</li>
            <li>Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the drag.on's lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions whenthe dragon is at rest.</li>
            <li>Icy walls block off areas in the dragon's lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>White Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_whitedragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">White Dragon</link>
          <p>The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic ofthe chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.</p>
          <p>A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Primal and Vengeful.</i>
            </b> White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters amongall dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.</p>
          <p>A white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warningsto intruders.</p>
          <p>Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unlessmoved to do so.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Lone Masters.</i>
            </b> White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.</p>
          <p>White dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids thatdemonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.</p>
          <p>Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a whitedragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Treasure Under Ice.</i>
            </b> White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities,particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arcticclimes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bonesculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.</p>
          <p>Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikesthem. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.</p>
          <p>A white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature makingthe offer and seize the treasure on their own.</p>
          <h>A White Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.</p>
          <p>A legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon's presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.</p>
          <p>A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in itslair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair actionagain or until the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can seewithin 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li>
            <li>The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary white dragon's lairis warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.</li>
            <li>Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the drag.on's lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions whenthe dragon is at rest.</li>
            <li>Icy walls block off areas in the dragon's lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>Brass Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_brassdragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Brass Dragon</link>
          <p>The most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons crave conversation, sunlight, and hot, dry climates.</p>
          <p>A brass dragon's head is defined by the broad protective plate that expands from its forehead and the spikes protruding from its chin. A frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down the length of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling's scales are a dull, mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon's scales begin to shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster.Its wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As a brass dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Boldly Talkative.</i>
            </b> A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughoutits long life, accumulating useful information which itwill gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligentcreature tries to leave a brass dragon's presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon's thirst for small talk is slaked.</p>
          <p>A brass dragon is trusting of creatures that appear to enjoy conversation as much as it does, but is smart enough to know when it is being manipulated. When that happens, the dragon often responds in kind, treating a bout of mutual trickery as a game.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Prized Treasures.</i>
            </b> Brass dragons covet magic items that allow them to converse with interesting personalities. An intelligent telepathic weapon or amagic lamp with a djinni bound inside it are among the greatest treasures a brass dragon can possess.</p>
          <p>Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps. Adventurers and wanderers should be wary if they happen across a chest hidden in an oasis or a treasure cache tucked away in a half-buried desert ruin, for these might be parts of a brass dragon's hoard.</p>
          <h>A Brass Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>A brass dragon's desert lair is typically a ruin, canyon, or cave network with ceiling holes to allow for sunlight.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>

            <li>A strong wind blows around the dragon. Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away fromthe dragon and knocked prone.

          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary brass dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the drag.on's lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed.</li>
            <li>Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the des.ert sands within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it's an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physicalinteraction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.</li>
            <li>Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon's lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature's presence and location.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the tracks fade in 1d10 days, but the other effects fade immediately.</p>
          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>
          <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Noble Curiosity.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons covet treasureas do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p>
          <p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Solitary Shapeshifters.</i>
            </b> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability toassume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture andcuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
          <p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away fromcivilization as possible so as to not attract enemies.However, this means that they are often far out of touchwith current events.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>The Persistence of Memory.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragonshave long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoidbloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assumingthat the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>King of Good Dragons.</i>
            </b> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p>
          <p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication tojustice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>

          <h>Brass Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_brassdragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Brass Dragon</link>
          <p>The most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons crave conversation, sunlight, and hot, dry climates.</p>
          <p>A brass dragon's head is defined by the broad protective plate that expands from its forehead and the spikes protruding from its chin. A frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down the length of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling's scales are a dull, mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon's scales begin to shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster.Its wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As a brass dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Boldly Talkative.</i>
            </b> A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughoutits long life, accumulating useful information which itwill gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligentcreature tries to leave a brass dragon's presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon's thirst for small talk is slaked.</p>
          <p>A brass dragon is trusting of creatures that appear to enjoy conversation as much as it does, but is smart enough to know when it is being manipulated. When that happens, the dragon often responds in kind, treating a bout of mutual trickery as a game.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Prized Treasures.</i>
            </b> Brass dragons covet magic items that allow them to converse with interesting personalities. An intelligent telepathic weapon or amagic lamp with a djinni bound inside it are among the greatest treasures a brass dragon can possess.</p>
          <p>Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps. Adventurers and wanderers should be wary if they happen across a chest hidden in an oasis or a treasure cache tucked away in a half-buried desert ruin, for these might be parts of a brass dragon's hoard.</p>
          <h>A Brass Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>A brass dragon's desert lair is typically a ruin, canyon, or cave network with ceiling holes to allow for sunlight.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>A strong wind blows around the dragon. Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away fromthe dragon and knocked prone. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames areextinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.</li>
            <li>A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary brass dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the drag.on's lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed.</li>
            <li>Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the des.ert sands within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it's an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physicalinteraction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.</li>
            <li>Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon's lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature's presence and location.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the tracks fade in 1d10 days, but the other effects fade immediately.</p>

          <p>The most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons crave conversation, sunlight, and hot, dry climates.</p>
          <p>A brass dragon's head is defined by the broad protective plate that expands from its forehead and the spikes protruding from its chin. A frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down the length of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling's scales are a dull, mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon's scales begin to shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster.Its wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As a brass dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs.</p>

            <b>
              <i>Boldly Talkative.</i>
            </b> A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughoutits long life, accumulating useful information which itwill gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligentcreature tries to leave a brass dragon's presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon's thirst for small talk is slaked.</p>
          <p>A brass dragon is trusting of creatures that appear to enjoy conversation as much as it does, but is smart enough to know when it is being manipulated. When that happens, the dragon often responds in kind, treating a bout of mutual trickery as a game.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Prized Treasures.</i>
            </b> Brass dragons covet magic items that allow them to converse with interesting personalities. An intelligent telepathic weapon or amagic lamp with a djinni bound inside it are among the greatest treasures a brass dragon can possess.</p>
          <p>Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps. Adventurers and wanderers should be wary if they happen across a chest hidden in an oasis or a treasure cache tucked away in a half-buried desert ruin, for these might be parts of a brass dragon's hoard.</p>
          <h>A Brass Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>A brass dragon's desert lair is typically a ruin, canyon, or cave network with ceiling holes to allow for sunlight.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>A strong wind blows around the dragon. Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away fromthe dragon and knocked prone. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames areextinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.</li>
            <li>A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary brass dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the drag.on's lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed.</li>
            <li>Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the des.ert sands within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it's an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physicalinteraction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.</li>
            <li>Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon's lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature's presence and location.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the tracks fade in 1d10 days, but the other effects fade immediately.</p>
          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>
          <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Noble Curiosity.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons covet treasureas do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p>
          <p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Solitary Shapeshifters.</i>
            </b> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability toassume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture andcuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
          <p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away fromcivilization as possible so as to not attract enemies.However, this means that they are often far out of touchwith current events.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>The Persistence of Memory.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragonshave long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoidbloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assumingthat the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>King of Good Dragons.</i>
            </b> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p>
          <p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication tojustice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>

          <h>Bronze Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_bronzedragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Bronze Dragon</link>
          <p>Bronze dragons are coastal dwellers that feed primarily on aquatic plants and fish. They take the forms of friendly animals to observe other creatures of interest. They are also fascinated by warfare and eagerly join armies fighting for a just cause.</p>
          <p>A ribbed and fluted crest defines the shape of a bronze dragon's head. Curving horns extend out from the crest, echoed by spines on its lower jaw and chin. To help them swim, bronze dragons have webbed feet and smooth scales. A bronze wyrmling's scales are yellow tinged with green; only as the dragon approaches adulthood does its color deepen to a darker, rich bronze tone. The pupils of a bronze dragon's eyes fade as the dragon ages, until they resemble glowing green orbs.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dragons of the Coast.</i>
            </b> Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the ship's captain for the item.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>War Machines.</i>
            </b> Bronze dragons actively oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by putting their size and strength to good use.When a conflict unfolds near its lair, a bronze dragon ascertains the underlying cause, then offers its services to any side that fights for good. Once a bronze dragon commits to a cause, it remains a staunch ally.</p>
          <p>Well-Organized Wealth. Bronze dragons loot sunken ships and also collect colorful coral and pearls from the reefs and seabeds near their lairs. When a bronze dragon pledges to help an army wage war against tyranny, it asks for nominal payment. If such a request is beyond its allies' means, it might settle for a collection of old books on military history or a ceremonial item commemorating the alliance. A bronze dragon mightalso lay claim to a treasure held by the enemy that it feels would be safer under its protection.</p>
          <h>A Bronze Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>A bronze dragon lairs in coastal caves. It might salvage a wrecked ship, reconstruct it within the confines of its lair, and use it as a treasure vault or nest for its eggs.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragontakes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The dragon creates fog as though it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
            <li>A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within a 20-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) thunder damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary bronze dragon's lairis warped by the dragon's magic.</p>
          <list>
            <li>Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn't need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.</li>
            <li>Underwater plants within 6 miles of the dragon's lair take on dazzlingly brilliant hues.</li>
            <li>Within its lair, the dragon can set illusory sounds,such as soft music and strange echoes, so that they can be heard in various parts of the lair.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>
          <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Noble Curiosity.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p>
          <p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Solitary Shape shifters.</i>
            </b> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
          <p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away fromcivilization as possible so as to not attract enemies.However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>The Persistence of Memory.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>King of Good Dragons.</i>
            </b> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p>
          <p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>

              <i>The Persistence of Memory.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>King of Good Dragons.</i>
            </b> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p>
          <p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>

            <desc type="string">Despite their gregarious and even-tempered natures, they possess a covetous, miserly streak, and can become dangerous when their hoards are threatened. A copper dragon has brow plates jutting over its eyes, extending back to long horns that grow as a series of overlapping segments. Its backswept cheek ridges and jaw frills give it a pensive look. At birth, a copper dragon's scales are a ruddy brown with a metallic tint. As the dragon ages, its scales become more coppery in color, later taking on a green tint as it ages. A copper dragon's pupils fade with age, and the eyes of the oldest copper dragons resemble glowing turquoise orbs. #bis;Good Hosts. A copper dragon appreciates wit, a good joke, humorous story, or riddle. A copper dragon becomes annoyed with any creature that doesn't laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor.</desc>

            <desc type="string">A dragon might carve out part of its lair as a temporary abode for a bard willing to regale it with stories, riddles, and music. To a copper dragon, such companionship is a treasure to be coveted. #bis;Cautious and Crafty. When building its hoard, a copper dragon prefers treasures from the earth. Metals and precious stones are favorites of these creatures.</desc>

          <id-00007>
            <name type="string">A copper dragon is wary when it comes to showing off its possessions</name>
            <desc type="string">If it knows that other creatures seek a specific item in its hoard, a copper dragon will not admit to possessing the item. Instead, it might send curious treasure hunters on a wild goose chase to search for the object while it watches from afar for its own pleasure. #h;A Copper Dragon's Lair Copper dragons dwell in dry uplands and on hilltops, where they make their lairs in narrow caves. False walls in the lair hide secret antechambers where the dragon stores valuable ores, art objects, and other oddities it has collected over its lifetime. Worthless items are put on display in open caves to tantalize treasure seekers and distract them from where the real treasure is hidden. Lair Actions On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects: #ls; #li;The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the spike growth spelland lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again oruntil the dragon dies. #li;The dragon chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become restrained. A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the restrained condition on a success. Moving 1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initia. tive count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free increases to 20. #le; #h;Regional Effects The region containing a legendary copper dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects: #ls; #li;Magic carvings of the dragon's smiling visage can be seen worked into stone terrain and objects within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. #li;Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are nor.mally unable to speak gain the magical ability tospeak and understand Draconic while within 1 mileof the dragon's lair. These creatures speak well of the dragon, but can't divulge its whereabouts. #li;Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the dragon's lairare prone to fits of giggling. Even serious matters sud.denly seem amusing. #le; If the dragon dies, the magic carvings fade over the course of 1d10 days. The other effects end immediately. #h;Metallic Dragons Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world. #bis;Noble Curiosity. Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</desc>

            <name type="string">A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good</name>
            <desc type="string">However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item. #bis;Solitary Shape shifters. At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</desc>

            <name type="string">Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away fromcivilization as possible so as to not attract enemies</name>
            <desc type="string">However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events. #bis;The Persistence of Memory. Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before. #bis;King of Good Dragons. The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form. Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</desc>

Instead, it might send curious treasure hunters on a wild goose chase to search for the object while it watches from afar for its own pleasure. #h;A Copper Dragon's Lair Copper dragons dwell in dry uplands and on hilltops, where they make their lairs in narrow caves. False walls in the lair hide secret antechambers where the dragon stores valuable ores, art objects, and other oddities it has collected over its lifetime. Worthless items are put on display in open caves to tantalize treasure seekers and distract them from where the real treasure is hidden. Lair Actions On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects: #ls; #li;The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the spike growth spelland lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again oruntil the dragon dies. #li;The dragon chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become restrained. A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the restrained condition on a success. Moving 1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initia. tive count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free increases to 20. #le; #h;Regional Effects The region containing a legendary copper dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects: #ls; #li;Magic carvings of the dragon's smiling visage can be seen worked into stone terrain and objects within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. #li;Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are nor.mally unable to speak gain the magical ability tospeak and understand Draconic while within 1 mileof the dragon's lair.

          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the spike growth spelland lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again oruntil the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>The dragon chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become restrained. A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the restrained condition on a success. Moving 1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initia. tive count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free increases to 20.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary copper dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Magic carvings of the dragon's smiling visage can be seen worked into stone terrain and objects within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.</li>
            <li>Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are nor.mally unable to speak gain the magical ability tospeak and understand Draconic while within 1 mileof the dragon's lair. These creatures speak well of the dragon, but can't divulge its whereabouts.</li>
            <li>Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the dragon's lairare prone to fits of giggling. Even serious matters sud.denly seem amusing.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the magic carvings fade over the course of 1d10 days. The other effects end immediately.</p>
          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>
          <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Noble Curiosity.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p>
          <p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Solitary Shape shifters.</i>
            </b> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
          <p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away fromcivilization as possible so as to not attract enemies.However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>The Persistence of Memory.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>King of Good Dragons.</i>
            </b> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p>
          <p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>

          <h>Gold Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_golddragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Gold Dragon</link>
          <p>The most powerful and majestic of the metallic dragons, gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil.</p>
          <p>A gold dragon has a sagacious face anointed with flexible spines that resemble whiskers. Its horns sweep back from its nose and brow, echoing twin frills that adorn its long neck. A gold dragon's sail-like wings start at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting it fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming through the air. A gold dragon wyrmling has scales of dark yellow with metallic flecks. Those flecks grow larger as the dragon matures. As a gold dragon ages, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble pools of molten gold.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Devourer of Wealth.</i>
            </b> Gold dragons can eat just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn't need to gorge itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren't bribes.</p>
          <p>Reserved Shape shifters. Gold dragons are respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness, but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other dragons</p>
          <p>except their own mates and offspring.</p>
          <p>Older gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid forms. Rarely does a gold dragon in disguise reveal its true form. In the guise of a peddler, it might regularly visit a town to catch up on local gossip, patronize honest businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways. In the guise of an animal, the dragon might befriend a lost child, a wandering minstrel, or an innkeeper, serving asa companion for days or weeks on end.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Master Hoarders.</i>
            </b> A gold dragon keeps its hoard in a well-guarded vault deep within its lair. Magical wards placed on the vault make it all but impossible to remove any treasures without the dragon knowing about it.</p>
          <h>A Gold Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Gold dragons make their homes in out-of-the-way places, where they can do as they please without arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes  and rivers, mist-shrouded islands, cave complexes hidden behind sparkling waterfalls, or ancient ruins.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws untilinitiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
            <li>One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of existence the dragon has imagined into being. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the dragon's. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary gold dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its con.versation with the dragon upon waking.</li>
            <li>Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within6 miles of the dragon's lair. The mist doesn't obscure anything. It assumes haunting forms when evil crea.tures are near the dragon or other non-evil creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.</li>
            <li>Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the dragon's lair sparkle and gleam, shedding dim light in a5-foot radius.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, these effects end immediately.</p>
          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>

          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_golddragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Gold Dragon</link>
          <p>The most powerful and majestic of the metallic dragons, gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil.</p>
          <p>A gold dragon has a sagacious face anointed with flexible spines that resemble whiskers. Its horns sweep back from its nose and brow, echoing twin frills that adorn its long neck. A gold dragon's sail-like wings start at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting it fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming through the air. A gold dragon wyrmling has scales of dark yellow with metallic flecks. Those flecks grow larger as the dragon matures. As a gold dragon ages, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble pools of molten gold.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Devourer of Wealth.</i>
            </b> Gold dragons can eat just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn't need to gorge itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren't bribes.</p>
          <p>Reserved Shape shifters. Gold dragons are respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness, but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other dragons</p>
          <p>except their own mates and offspring.</p>
          <p>Older gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid forms. Rarely does a gold dragon in disguise reveal its true form. In the guise of a peddler, it might regularly visit a town to catch up on local gossip, patronize honest businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways. In the guise of an animal, the dragon might befriend a lost child, a wandering minstrel, or an innkeeper, serving asa companion for days or weeks on end.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Master Hoarders.</i>
            </b> A gold dragon keeps its hoard in a well-guarded vault deep within its lair. Magical wards placed on the vault make it all but impossible to remove any treasures without the dragon knowing about it.</p>
          <h>A Gold Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Gold dragons make their homes in out-of-the-way places, where they can do as they please without arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes  and rivers, mist-shrouded islands, cave complexes hidden behind sparkling waterfalls, or ancient ruins.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws untilinitiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
            <li>One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of existence the dragon has imagined into being. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the dragon's. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary gold dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its con.versation with the dragon upon waking.</li>
            <li>Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within6 miles of the dragon's lair. The mist doesn't obscure anything. It assumes haunting forms when evil crea.tures are near the dragon or other non-evil creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.</li>
            <li>Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the dragon's lair sparkle and gleam, shedding dim light in a5-foot radius.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, these effects end immediately.</p>
          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>
          <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Noble Curiosity.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p>
          <p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Solitary Shape shifters.</i>
            </b> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
          <p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away fromcivilization as possible so as to not attract enemies.However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>The Persistence of Memory.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>King of Good Dragons.</i>
            </b> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p>
          <p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>

          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_golddragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Gold Dragon</link>
          <p>The most powerful and majestic of the metallic dragons, gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil.</p>
          <p>A gold dragon has a sagacious face anointed with flexible spines that resemble whiskers. Its horns sweep back from its nose and brow, echoing twin frills that adorn its long neck. A gold dragon's sail-like wings start at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting it fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming through the air. A gold dragon wyrmling has scales of dark yellow with metallic flecks. Those flecks grow larger as the dragon matures. As a gold dragon ages, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble pools of molten gold.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Devourer of Wealth.</i>
            </b> Gold dragons can eat just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn't need to gorge itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren't bribes.</p>
          <p>Reserved Shape shifters. Gold dragons are respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness, but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other dragons</p>
          <p>except their own mates and offspring.</p>
          <p>Older gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid forms. Rarely does a gold dragon in disguise reveal its true form. In the guise of a peddler, it might regularly visit a town to catch up on local gossip, patronize honest businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways. In the guise of an animal, the dragon might befriend a lost child, a wandering minstrel, or an innkeeper, serving asa companion for days or weeks on end.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Master Hoarders.</i>
            </b> A gold dragon keeps its hoard in a well-guarded vault deep within its lair. Magical wards placed on the vault make it all but impossible to remove any treasures without the dragon knowing about it.</p>
          <h>A Gold Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Gold dragons make their homes in out-of-the-way places, where they can do as they please without arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes  and rivers, mist-shrouded islands, cave complexes hidden behind sparkling waterfalls, or ancient ruins.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws untilinitiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
            <li>One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of existence the dragon has imagined into being. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the dragon's. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary gold dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its con.versation with the dragon upon waking.</li>
            <li>Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within6 miles of the dragon's lair. The mist doesn't obscure anything. It assumes haunting forms when evil crea.tures are near the dragon or other non-evil creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.</li>
            <li>Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the dragon's lair sparkle and gleam, shedding dim light in a5-foot radius.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, these effects end immediately.</p>
          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>
          <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Noble Curiosity.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p>
          <p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Solitary Shape shifters.</i>
            </b> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
          <p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies.However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>The Persistence of Memory.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>King of Good Dragons.</i>
            </b> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p>
          <p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>

          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_silverdragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Silver Dragon</link>
          <p>The friendliest and most social of the metallic dragons, silver dragons cheerfully assist good creatures in need.</p>
          <p>A silver dragon shimmers as if sculpted from pure metal, its face given a noble cast by its high eyes and sweeping beard-like chin spikes. A spiny frill rises high over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip of its tail. A silver wyrmling's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dragons of Virtue.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons believe that livinga moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one's actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don't take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Friends of the Small Races.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong friendships.</p>
          <p>Silver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Respect for Humanity.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don't. Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find fascinating.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Hoarding History.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons love to possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen</p>
          <p>humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine jewellery crafted by numerous races. Other treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities.</p>
          <h>A Silver Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Silver dragons dwell among the clouds, making their lairs on secluded cold mountain peaks. Though many are comfortable in natural cavern complexes or abandoned mines, silver dragons covet the lost outposts of humanoid civilization. An abandoned mountaintopcitadel or a remote tower raised by a long-dead wizard is the sort of lair that every silver dragon dreams of.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The dragon creates fog as if it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
            <li>A blisteringly cold wind blows through the lair near the dragon. Each creature within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) cold damage. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary silver dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects.</p>
          <list>
            <li>Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn't need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.</li>
            <li>Within 1 mile of the lair, winds buoy non-evil creaturesthat fall due to no act of the dragon's or its allies. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.</li>
            <li>Given days or longer to work, the dragon can make clouds and fog within its lair as solid as stone, forming structures and other objects as it wishes. If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>
          <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Noble Curiosity.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p>
          <p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Solitary Shape shifters.</i>
            </b> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
          <p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies.However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>The Persistence of Memory.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>King of Good Dragons.</i>
            </b> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p>
          <p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>

          <h>Silver Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_silverdragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Silver Dragon</link>
          <p>The friendliest and most social of the metallic dragons, silver dragons cheerfully assist good creatures in need.</p>
          <p>A silver dragon shimmers as if sculpted from pure metal, its face given a noble cast by its high eyes and sweeping beard-like chin spikes. A spiny frill rises high over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip of its tail. A silver wyrmling's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dragons of Virtue.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons believe that livinga moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one's actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don't take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Friends of the Small Races.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong friendships.</p>
          <p>Silver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Respect for Humanity.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don't. Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find fascinating.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Hoarding History.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons love to possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen</p>
          <p>humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine jewellery crafted by numerous races. Other treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities.</p>
          <h>A Silver Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Silver dragons dwell among the clouds, making their lairs on secluded cold mountain peaks.

          <p>The friendliest and most social of the metallic dragons, silver dragons cheerfully assist good creatures in need.</p>
          <p>A silver dragon shimmers as if sculpted from pure metal, its face given a noble cast by its high eyes and sweeping beard-like chin spikes. A spiny frill rises high over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip of its tail. A silver wyrmling's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dragons of Virtue.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons believe that livinga moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one's actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don't take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Friends of the Small Races.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong friendships.</p>
          <p>Silver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Respect for Humanity.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don't. Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find fascinating.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Hoarding History.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons love to possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen</p>
          <p>humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine jewellery crafted by numerous races. Other treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities.</p>
          <h>A Silver Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Silver dragons dwell among the clouds, making their lairs on secluded cold mountain peaks. Though many are comfortable in natural cavern complexes or abandoned mines, silver dragons covet the lost outposts of humanoid civilization. An abandoned mountaintopcitadel or a remote tower raised by a long-dead wizard is the sort of lair that every silver dragon dreams of.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The dragon creates fog as if it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
            <li>A blisteringly cold wind blows through the lair near the dragon. Each creature within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) cold damage. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary silver dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects.</p>
          <list>
            <li>Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn't need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.</li>
            <li>Within 1 mile of the lair, winds buoy non-evil creaturesthat fall due to no act of the dragon's or its allies. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.</li>
            <li>Given days or longer to work, the dragon can make clouds and fog within its lair as solid as stone, forming structures and other objects as it wishes. If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>
          <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Noble Curiosity.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p>
          <p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Solitary Shape shifters.</i>
            </b> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
          <p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies.However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>The Persistence of Memory.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>King of Good Dragons.</i>
            </b> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p>
          <p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>

          <p>Dragon turtles are among the most fearsome creatures of the oceans. As large and voracious as the oldest of its land-based dragon kin, a dragon turtle strikes with its deadly jaws, steaming breath, and crushing tail.</p>
          <p>A dragon turtle's rough shell is the same dark green color as the deep water where this monster dwells. Silver highlights lining the shell resemble lightdancing on open water, and a surfacing dragon turtle is sometimes mistaken for the reflection of the sun or moon on the waves. Dragons of the Deep. Like true dragons, dragon turtles collect treasure, first by sinking ships and then by sifting through the wreckage for coins and other precious items. A dragon turtle swallows treasure for transport, then regurgitates it when it reaches its lair.</p>
          <p>Dragon turtles dwell in caves hidden in coral reefs or beneath the seafloor, or along rugged stretches of coastline. If a choice cave is already inhabited, a dragon turtle attacks its current residents in an attempt to take over.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Mercenary Monsters.</i>
            </b> A dragon turtle is smart enough to be bribed, and pirates sailing seas patrolled by these creatures quickly learn to offer them treasure in exchange for safe passage. Clever sahuagin sometimes ally with dragon turtles, enticing themwith treasure to use their blistering breath weapons in sahuagin raids against ships and coastal settlements.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Elemental Might.</i>
            </b> Dragon turtles sometimes find theirway through sunken planar rifts to the Elemental Planeof Water. Those monstrous specimens can often be found in the service of marids, which strap magnificent coral thrones to the backs of dragon turtles and ride them as mounts.</p>

          <p>The elusive pseudodragon dwells in the quiet places of the world, making its home in the hollows of trees and small caves. With its red-brown scales, horns, and a maw filled with sharp teeth, a pseudodragon resembles a tiny red dragon but its disposition is playful.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Quiet and Defensive.</i>
            </b> Pseudodragons have little interest in other creatures, and they avoid them whenever possible. If it is attacked, a pseudodragon fights back using the poisonous stinger at the tip of its tail, one jab of which can put a creature into a catatonic state that can last for hours.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Draconic Familiars.</i>
            </b> Mages often seek out pseudodragons, whose agreeable disposition, telepathic ability, and resistance to magic make them superior familiars. Pseudodragons are selective when it comes to choosing companions, but they can sometimes be won over with gifts of food or treasure. When a pseudodragon finds an agreeable companion, it bonds with that person as long as it is treated fairly.</p>
          <p>A pseudodragon puts up with no ill treatment, and it abandons a manipulative or abusive companion without warning.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Language of Emotion.</i>
            </b> Pseudodragons can't speak, but they communicate using a limited form of telepathy that allows them to share basic ideas such as hunger, curiosity, or affection. When it bonds with a companion, a pseudodragon can communicate what it sees and hears even over long distances.</p>
          <p>A pseudodragon often vocalizes animal noises. A rasping purr indicates pleasure, while a hiss means unpleasant surprise. A bird-like chirping represents desire, and a growl always means anger or discontent.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Variant: Pseudodragon Familiar</b>
          </p>
          <p>Some pseudodragons are willing to serve spellcasters as a familiar. Such pseudodragons have the following trait.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Familiar.</i>
            </b> The pseudodragon can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the pseudodragon senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the pseudodragon is within 10 feet of its companion, the companion shares the pseudodragon's Magic Resistance trait. At any time and for any reason, the pseudodragon can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.</p>

          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_wyvern_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Wyvern</link>
          <p>Travelers in the wild sometimes look to the skies to see the dark-winged shape of a wyvern carrying its prey. These cousins to the great dragons hunt the same tangled forests and caverns as their kin. Their appearance sends ripples of alarm through the borderlands of civilization.</p>
          <p>A wyvern has two scaly legs, leathery wings, and a sinewy tail topped with its most potent weapon: a poison stinger. The poison in a wyvern's stinger can kill a creature in seconds. Extremely potent, wyvern poison burns through its victim's bloodstream, disintegrating veins and arteries on its way to the heart. As deadly as wyverns can be, however, hunters and adventurers often track them to claim the venom, which is used in alchemical compounds and to coat weapons.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Aerial Hunters.</i>
            </b> A wyvern doesn't fight on the ground unless it can't reach its prey by any other means, or if it has been fooled into a position from which aerial combat isn't an option. If forced into a confrontation on the ground, a wyvern crouches low, keeping its stinger poised above its head as it hisses and growls.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Aggressive and Reckless.</i>
            </b> A wyvern intent on its prey backs down only if it sustains serious injury, or if its prey eludes it long enough for another easier potential meal to wander along. If it corners a fleeing creature in an enclosure too small to enter, a wyvern guards where the quarry hides, lashing with its stinger whenever opportunity allows.</p>
          <p>Although they possess more cunning than ordinary beasts, wyverns lack the intelligence of their draconic cousins. As such, creatures that maintain their composure as a wyvern hunts them from the air can often elude or trick it. Wyverns follow a direct path to their prey, with no thought given to possible ambushes.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Tamed Wyverns.</i>
            </b> A wyvern can be tamed for use as a mount, but doing so presents a difficult and deadly challenge. Raising one as a hatchling offers the best results. However, a wyvern's violent temperament has cost the life of many a would-be master.</p>

          <p>Shadow dragons are true dragons that were either born in the Shadowfell or transformed by years spent within its dismal confines. Some shadow dragons embrace the Shadowfell for its bleak landscapes and desolation.Others seek to return to the Material Plane, hungry to spread the darkness and evil of the Plane of Shadow.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dark Portals.</i>
            </b> Portals to the Shadowfell manifest in forlorn places and the deep gloom of subterranean caverns. The dragons that lair in such places often discover these portals and find themselves transported to a new realm. Ancient dragons that sleep in their lairs for months or years at a time might find themselves spirited away, never knowing that a portal has formed without their knowledge as they dream.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Recast in Shadow.</i>
            </b> The transformation to a shadow dragon happens over a period of years, during which time a dragon's scales lose their luster and fade to a charcoal hue. Its leathery wings become translucent, its eyes paling to pools of opalescent gray. Shadow dragons find sunlight abhorrent, and they are weaker in bright light than they are in darkness. Darkness makes thedragon fade to a spectral shadow of its former self.</p>
          <p>The magical nature of dragons holds an attraction for the Shadowfell, which seems somehow to crave the might and majesty of these great reptiles. The Shadowfell also has a dispiriting effect on its denizens, such that the longer a creature remains on the plane, the more it accepts the plane's malaise. As months and years pass for a dragon on the Shadowfell, it becomes aware of the transformation being wrought upon it, and yet can do nothing to prevent it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Back in the World.</i>
            </b> A shadow dragon is so suffused with the power of the Shadowfell that even a return tothe Material Plane can't undo its transformation. Some shadow dragons attempt to lure other creatures from the mortal realm back to the Shadowfell to keep them company, at least until they tire of their guests and devour them. Others are happy to leave the Shadowfell behind forever, understanding that treasure and powerare easier to come by in the Material Plane.</p>
          <h>Shadow Dragon Template</h>
          <p>Only a true dragon can transform into a shadow dragon, and only if it is born in the Shadowfell or remains there for several years. A dracolich can't be turned into a shadow dragon, since it loses its draconic nature when it becomes undead.</p>

          <h>Black Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_blackdragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Black Dragon</link>
          <p>The most evil-tempered and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.</p>
          <p>With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon's face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.</p>
          <p>When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Brutal and Cruel.</i>
            </b> All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.</p>
          <p>A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Foes and Servants.</i>
            </b> Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.</p>
          <p>Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons,raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food togive as tribute and building crude draconic effigies alongthe borders of their dragon master's domain.</p>
          <p>A black dragon's malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon's lair.</p>
          <p>Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipedebites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon's hunger.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Wealth of the Ancients.</i>
            </b> Black dragons hoard the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current civilizations for itself.</p>
          <h>A Black Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon's lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.</li>
            <li>A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action,uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li>
            <li>Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary black dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.</li>
            <li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernat.urally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink suchwater regurgitate it within minutes.</li>
            <li>Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_blackdragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Black Dragon</link>
          <p>The most evil-tempered and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.</p>
          <p>With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon's face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.</p>
          <p>When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Brutal and Cruel.</i>
            </b> All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.</p>
          <p>A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Foes and Servants.</i>
            </b> Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.</p>
          <p>Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons,raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food togive as tribute and building crude draconic effigies alongthe borders of their dragon master's domain.</p>
          <p>A black dragon's malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon's lair.</p>
          <p>Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipedebites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon's hunger.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Wealth of the Ancients.</i>
            </b> Black dragons hoard the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current civilizations for itself.</p>
          <h>A Black Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon's lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.</li>
            <li>A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action,uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li>
            <li>Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary black dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.</li>
            <li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernat.urally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink suchwater regurgitate it within minutes.</li>
            <li>Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world.

          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <p>The most evil-tempered and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.</p>
          <p>With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon's face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.</p>
          <p>When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Brutal and Cruel.</i>
            </b> All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.</p>
          <p>A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Foes and Servants.</i>
            </b> Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.</p>
          <p>Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons,raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food togive as tribute and building crude draconic effigies alongthe borders of their dragon master's domain.</p>
          <p>A black dragon's malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon's lair.</p>
          <p>Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipedebites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon's hunger.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Wealth of the Ancients.</i>
            </b> Black dragons hoard the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current civilizations for itself.</p>
          <h>A Black Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon's lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.</li>
            <li>A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action,uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li>
            <li>Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary black dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.</li>
            <li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernat.urally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink suchwater regurgitate it within minutes.</li>
            <li>Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, andsubservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

            <li>A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action,uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li>
            <li>Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</li>

            <li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernat.urally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink suchwater regurgitate it within minutes.</li>
            <li>Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, andsubservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>Blue Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_bluedragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Blue Dragon</link>
          <p>Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert's reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Vain and Deadly.</i>
            </b> A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm's reach as it waits to attack again.</p>
          <p>Desert Predators. Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habitsmake blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.</p>
          <p>When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Overlords and Minions.</i>
            </b> Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.</p>
          <p>Hoarders of Gems. Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewellery and magic items adorned with those gems.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.</p>
          <h>A Blue Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowingability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnelsbeneath the sands.</p>
          <p>Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon's lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilatethe lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that</p>
          <p>are the dragon's first line of defense.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows</p>
          <p>out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated.</p>
          <p>When it returns later, it collects its possessions-along with the wealth of the dead intruders.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon</p>
          <p>takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.</li>
            <li>A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
            <li>Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.</li>
            <li>Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (-5).</li>
            <li>Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 + 10 feet into the sinkhole.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.</p>

          <h>Blue Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_bluedragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Blue Dragon</link>
          <p>Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert's reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Vain and Deadly.</i>
            </b> A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm's reach as it waits to attack again.</p>
          <p>Desert Predators. Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habitsmake blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.</p>
          <p>When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Overlords and Minions.</i>
            </b> Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.</p>
          <p>Hoarders of Gems. Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewellery and magic items adorned with those gems.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.</p>
          <h>A Blue Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowingability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnelsbeneath the sands.</p>
          <p>Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon's lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilatethe lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that</p>
          <p>are the dragon's first line of defense.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows</p>
          <p>out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated.</p>
          <p>When it returns later, it collects its possessions-along with the wealth of the dead intruders.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon</p>
          <p>takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.</li>
            <li>A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
            <li>Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.</li>
            <li>Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (-5).</li>
            <li>Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 + 10 feet into the sinkhole.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <p>Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert's reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Vain and Deadly.</i>
            </b> A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm's reach as it waits to attack again.</p>
          <p>Desert Predators. Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habitsmake blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.</p>
          <p>When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Overlords and Minions.</i>
            </b> Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.</p>
          <p>Hoarders of Gems. Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewellery and magic items adorned with those gems.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.</p>
          <h>A Blue Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowingability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnelsbeneath the sands.</p>
          <p>Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon's lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilatethe lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that</p>
          <p>are the dragon's first line of defense.</p>
          <p>A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows</p>
          <p>out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated.</p>
          <p>When it returns later, it collects its possessions-along with the wealth of the dead intruders.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon</p>
          <p>takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.</li>
            <li>A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
            <li>Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.</li>
            <li>Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (-5).</li>
            <li>Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 + 10 feet into the sinkhole.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, andsubservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, andsubservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>Green Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_greendragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Green Dragon</link>
          <p>The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subvertingand corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.</p>
          <p>A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.</p>
          <p>A wyrmling green dragon's thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.</p>
          <p>A green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Capricious Hunters.</i>
            </b> A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.</p>
          <p>Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.</p>
          <p>A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Manipulative Schemers.</i>
            </b> A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creatureis only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.</p>
          <p>When manipulating other creatures, green dragonsare honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Conflict and Corruption.</i>
            </b> Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watch-sometimes for decades-for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.</p>
          <p>Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions' tortured dreams.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Living Treasures.</i>
            </b> A green dragon's favored treasuresare the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.</p>
          <h>A Green Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath.</p>
          <p>The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a mazeinto the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.</p>
          <p>At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partlysubmerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragontakes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wallsinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 onthe next round.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary green dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Thickets form labyrinthine passages within1 mile of the dragon's lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets,with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns.</li>
            <p>Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.</p>
            <li>Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path.</li>
            <li>Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, andsubservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>Green Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_greendragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Green Dragon</link>
          <p>The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subvertingand corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.</p>
          <p>A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.</p>
          <p>A wyrmling green dragon's thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.</p>
          <p>A green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Capricious Hunters.</i>
            </b> A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.</p>
          <p>Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.</p>
          <p>A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Manipulative Schemers.</i>
            </b> A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creatureis only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.</p>
          <p>When manipulating other creatures, green dragonsare honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Conflict and Corruption.</i>
            </b> Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watch-sometimes for decades-for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.</p>
          <p>Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions' tortured dreams.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Living Treasures.</i>
            </b> A green dragon's favored treasuresare the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.</p>
          <h>A Green Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath.</p>
          <p>The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a mazeinto the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.</p>
          <p>At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partlysubmerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragontakes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wallsinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 onthe next round.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary green dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Thickets form labyrinthine passages within1 mile of the dragon's lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets,with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns.</li>
            <p>Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.</p>
            <li>Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path.</li>
            <li>Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, andsubservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <p>The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subvertingand corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.</p>
          <p>A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.</p>
          <p>A wyrmling green dragon's thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.</p>
          <p>A green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Capricious Hunters.</i>
            </b> A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.</p>
          <p>Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.</p>
          <p>A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Manipulative Schemers.</i>
            </b> A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creatureis only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.</p>
          <p>When manipulating other creatures, green dragonsare honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Conflict and Corruption.</i>
            </b> Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watch-sometimes for decades-for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.</p>
          <p>Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions' tortured dreams.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Living Treasures.</i>
            </b> A green dragon's favored treasuresare the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.</p>
          <h>A Green Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath.</p>
          <p>The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a mazeinto the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.</p>
          <p>At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partlysubmerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragontakes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wallsinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 onthe next round.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary green dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Thickets form labyrinthine passages within1 mile of the dragon's lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets,with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns.</li>
            <p>Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.</p>
            <li>Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path.</li>
            <li>Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, andsubservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

            </b> A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.</p>
          <p>Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.</p>
          <p>A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Manipulative Schemers.</i>
            </b> A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creatureis only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.</p>
          <p>When manipulating other creatures, green dragonsare honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Conflict and Corruption.</i>
            </b> Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watch-sometimes for decades-for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.</p>
          <p>Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions' tortured dreams.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Living Treasures.</i>
            </b> A green dragon's favored treasuresare the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.</p>
          <h>A Green Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath.</p>
          <p>The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a mazeinto the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.</p>
          <p>At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partlysubmerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragontakes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wallsinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 onthe next round.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary green dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Thickets form labyrinthine passages within1 mile of the dragon's lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets,with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns.</li>
            <p>Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.</p>
            <li>Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path.</li>
            <li>Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, andsubservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>Red Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_reddragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Red Dragon</link>
          <p>The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures. The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.</p>
          <p>The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Mountain Masters.</i>
            </b> Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hill-dwelling copper dragons from time to time.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Arrogant Tyrants.</i>
            </b> Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.</p>
          <p>No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Status and Slaves.</i>
            </b> Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.</p>
          <p>When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Obsessive Collectors.</i>
            </b> Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary.They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.</p>
          <p>A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can't be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.</p>
          <h>A Red Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling incaverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards thathinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanicgases wash over a dragon as it sleeps. With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls-and the wider world it seeks to control.</p>
          <p>Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon's power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, tak.ing 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
            <li>A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>

          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, andsubservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>

              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>Red Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_reddragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Red Dragon</link>
          <p>The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures. The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.</p>
          <p>The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Mountain Masters.</i>
            </b> Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hill-dwelling copper dragons from time to time.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Arrogant Tyrants.</i>
            </b> Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.</p>
          <p>No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Status and Slaves.</i>
            </b> Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.</p>
          <p>When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Obsessive Collectors.</i>
            </b> Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary.They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.</p>
          <p>A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can't be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.</p>
          <h>A Red Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling incaverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards thathinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanicgases wash over a dragon as it sleeps. With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls-and the wider world it seeks to control.</p>
          <p>Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon's power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, tak.ing 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
            <li>A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
            <li>Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initia.tive count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary red dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>

            <li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernatu.rally warm and tainted by sulfur.</li>
            <li>Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing crea. tures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.</li>

            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerousand remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them.

          <p>The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures. The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.</p>
          <p>The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Mountain Masters.</i>
            </b> Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hill-dwelling copper dragons from time to time.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Arrogant Tyrants.</i>
            </b> Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.</p>
          <p>No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Status and Slaves.</i>
            </b> Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.</p>
          <p>When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Obsessive Collectors.</i>
            </b> Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary.They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.</p>
          <p>A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can't be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.</p>
          <h>A Red Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling incaverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards thathinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanicgases wash over a dragon as it sleeps. With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls-and the wider world it seeks to control.</p>
          <p>Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon's power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, tak.ing 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
            <li>A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
            <li>Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initia.tive count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary red dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of thedragon's lair.</li>
            <li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernatu.rally warm and tainted by sulfur.</li>
            <li>Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing crea. tures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>

          <h>A Red Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling incaverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards thathinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanicgases wash over a dragon as it sleeps. With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls-and the wider world it seeks to control.</p>
          <p>Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon's power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, tak.ing 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
            <li>A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
            <li>Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initia.tive count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary red dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of thedragon's lair.</li>
            <li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernatu.rally warm and tainted by sulfur.</li>
            <li>Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing crea. tures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>White Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_whitedragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">White Dragon</link>
          <p>The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic ofthe chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.</p>
          <p>A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Primal and Vengeful.</i>
            </b> White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters amongall dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.</p>
          <p>A white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warningsto intruders.</p>
          <p>Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unlessmoved to do so.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Lone Masters.</i>
            </b> White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.</p>
          <p>White dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids thatdemonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.</p>
          <p>Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a whitedragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Treasure Under Ice.</i>
            </b> White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities,particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arcticclimes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bonesculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.</p>
          <p>Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikesthem. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.</p>
          <p>A white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature makingthe offer and seize the treasure on their own.</p>
          <h>A White Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.</p>
          <p>A legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon's presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.</p>
          <p>A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in itslair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair actionagain or until the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can seewithin 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li>
            <li>The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary white dragon's lairis warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.</li>
            <li>Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the drag.on's lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions whenthe dragon is at rest.</li>
            <li>Icy walls block off areas in the dragon's lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>White Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_whitedragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">White Dragon</link>
          <p>The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic ofthe chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.</p>
          <p>A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Primal and Vengeful.</i>
            </b> White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters amongall dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.</p>
          <p>A white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warningsto intruders.</p>
          <p>Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unlessmoved to do so.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Lone Masters.</i>
            </b> White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.</p>
          <p>White dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids thatdemonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.</p>
          <p>Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a whitedragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Treasure Under Ice.</i>
            </b> White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities,particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arcticclimes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bonesculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.</p>
          <p>Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikesthem. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.</p>
          <p>A white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature makingthe offer and seize the treasure on their own.</p>
          <h>A White Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.</p>
          <p>A legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon's presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.</p>
          <p>A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in itslair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair actionagain or until the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can seewithin 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li>
            <li>The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary white dragon's lairis warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.</li>
            <li>Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the drag.on's lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions whenthe dragon is at rest.</li>
            <li>Icy walls block off areas in the dragon's lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_whitedragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">White Dragon</link>
          <p>The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic ofthe chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.</p>
          <p>A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Primal and Vengeful.</i>
            </b> White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters amongall dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.</p>
          <p>A white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warningsto intruders.</p>
          <p>Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unlessmoved to do so.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Lone Masters.</i>
            </b> White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.</p>
          <p>White dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids thatdemonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.</p>
          <p>Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a whitedragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Treasure Under Ice.</i>
            </b> White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities,particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arcticclimes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bonesculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.</p>
          <p>Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikesthem. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.</p>
          <p>A white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature makingthe offer and seize the treasure on their own.</p>
          <h>A White Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.</p>
          <p>A legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon's presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.</p>
          <p>A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in itslair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair actionagain or until the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can seewithin 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li>
            <li>The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary white dragon's lairis warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.</li>
            <li>Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the drag.on's lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions whenthe dragon is at rest.</li>
            <li>Icy walls block off areas in the dragon's lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power.

This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unlessmoved to do so.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Lone Masters.</i>
            </b> White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.</p>
          <p>White dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids thatdemonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.</p>
          <p>Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a whitedragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Treasure Under Ice.</i>
            </b> White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities,particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arcticclimes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bonesculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.</p>
          <p>Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikesthem. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.</p>
          <p>A white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature makingthe offer and seize the treasure on their own.</p>
          <h>A White Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.</p>
          <p>A legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon's presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.</p>
          <p>A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in itslair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair actionagain or until the dragon dies.</li>
            <li>Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can seewithin 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li>
            <li>The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary white dragon's lairis warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.</li>
            <li>Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the drag.on's lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions whenthe dragon is at rest.</li>
            <li>Icy walls block off areas in the dragon's lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Dragons</h>
          <p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p>
          <p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p>
          <p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
          <p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p>

          <h>Chromatic Dragons</h>
          <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerfultyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Driven by Greed.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Creatures of Ego.</i>
            </b> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dangerous Lairs.</i>
            </b> A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p>
          <p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Queen of Evil Dragons.</i>
            </b> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p>
          <p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p>
          <p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>

          <h>Brass Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_brassdragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Brass Dragon</link>
          <p>The most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons crave conversation, sunlight, and hot, dry climates.</p>
          <p>A brass dragon's head is defined by the broad protective plate that expands from its forehead and the spikes protruding from its chin. A frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down the length of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling's scales are a dull, mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon's scales begin to shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster.Its wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As a brass dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Boldly Talkative.</i>
            </b> A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughoutits long life, accumulating useful information which itwill gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligentcreature tries to leave a brass dragon's presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon's thirst for small talk is slaked.</p>
          <p>A brass dragon is trusting of creatures that appear to enjoy conversation as much as it does, but is smart enough to know when it is being manipulated. When that happens, the dragon often responds in kind, treating a bout of mutual trickery as a game.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Prized Treasures.</i>
            </b> Brass dragons covet magic items that allow them to converse with interesting personalities. An intelligent telepathic weapon or amagic lamp with a djinni bound inside it are among the greatest treasures a brass dragon can possess.</p>
          <p>Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps. Adventurers and wanderers should be wary if they happen across a chest hidden in an oasis or a treasure cache tucked away in a half-buried desert ruin, for these might be parts of a brass dragon's hoard.</p>
          <h>A Brass Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>A brass dragon's desert lair is typically a ruin, canyon, or cave network with ceiling holes to allow for sunlight.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>A strong wind blows around the dragon. Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away fromthe dragon and knocked prone. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames areextinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.</li>
            <li>A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary brass dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the drag.on's lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed.</li>
            <li>Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the des.ert sands within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it's an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physicalinteraction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.</li>
            <li>Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon's lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature's presence and location.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the tracks fade in 1d10 days, but the other effects fade immediately.</p>
          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>
          <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p>

              <i>Noble Curiosity.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons covet treasureas do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p>
          <p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Solitary Shapeshifters.</i>
            </b> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability toassume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture andcuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
          <p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away fromcivilization as possible so as to not attract enemies.However, this means that they are often far out of touchwith current events.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>The Persistence of Memory.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragonshave long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoidbloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assumingthat the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>King of Good Dragons.</i>
            </b> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p>
          <p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication tojustice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>

          <h>Brass Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_brassdragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Brass Dragon</link>
          <p>The most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons crave conversation, sunlight, and hot, dry climates.</p>
          <p>A brass dragon's head is defined by the broad protective plate that expands from its forehead and the spikes protruding from its chin. A frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down the length of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling's scales are a dull, mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon's scales begin to shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster.Its wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As a brass dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Boldly Talkative.</i>
            </b> A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughoutits long life, accumulating useful information which itwill gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligentcreature tries to leave a brass dragon's presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon's thirst for small talk is slaked.</p>
          <p>A brass dragon is trusting of creatures that appear to enjoy conversation as much as it does, but is smart enough to know when it is being manipulated. When that happens, the dragon often responds in kind, treating a bout of mutual trickery as a game.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Prized Treasures.</i>
            </b> Brass dragons covet magic items that allow them to converse with interesting personalities. An intelligent telepathic weapon or amagic lamp with a djinni bound inside it are among the greatest treasures a brass dragon can possess.</p>
          <p>Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps. Adventurers and wanderers should be wary if they happen across a chest hidden in an oasis or a treasure cache tucked away in a half-buried desert ruin, for these might be parts of a brass dragon's hoard.</p>
          <h>A Brass Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>A brass dragon's desert lair is typically a ruin, canyon, or cave network with ceiling holes to allow for sunlight.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>A strong wind blows around the dragon. Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away fromthe dragon and knocked prone. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames areextinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.</li>
            <li>A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary brass dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the drag.on's lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed.</li>
            <li>Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the des.ert sands within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it's an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physicalinteraction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.</li>
            <li>Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon's lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature's presence and location.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the tracks fade in 1d10 days, but the other effects fade immediately.</p>
          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>
          <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p>

          <p>Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps.

          <h>A Brass Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>A brass dragon's desert lair is typically a ruin, canyon, or cave network with ceiling holes to allow for sunlight.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>A strong wind blows around the dragon. Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away fromthe dragon and knocked prone. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames areextinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.</li>
            <li>A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary brass dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the drag.on's lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed.</li>
            <li>Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the des.ert sands within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it's an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physicalinteraction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.</li>
            <li>Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon's lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature's presence and location.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, the tracks fade in 1d10 days, but the other effects fade immediately.</p>

          <p>The most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons crave conversation, sunlight, and hot, dry climates.</p>
          <p>A brass dragon's head is defined by the broad protective plate that expands from its forehead and the spikes protruding from its chin. A frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down the length of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling's scales are a dull, mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon's scales begin to shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster.Its wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As a brass dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs.</p>

If an intelligentcreature tries to leave a brass dragon's presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature.

          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_bronzedragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Bronze Dragon</link>
          <p>Bronze dragons are coastal dwellers that feed primarily on aquatic plants and fish. They take the forms of friendly animals to observe other creatures of interest. They are also fascinated by warfare and eagerly join armies fighting for a just cause.</p>
          <p>A ribbed and fluted crest defines the shape of a bronze dragon's head. Curving horns extend out from the crest, echoed by spines on its lower jaw and chin. To help them swim, bronze dragons have webbed feet and smooth scales. A bronze wyrmling's scales are yellow tinged with green; only as the dragon approaches adulthood does its color deepen to a darker, rich bronze tone. The pupils of a bronze dragon's eyes fade as the dragon ages, until they resemble glowing green orbs.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dragons of the Coast.</i>
            </b> Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the ship's captain for the item.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>War Machines.</i>
            </b> Bronze dragons actively oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by putting their size and strength to good use.When a conflict unfolds near its lair, a bronze dragon ascertains the underlying cause, then offers its services to any side that fights for good. Once a bronze dragon commits to a cause, it remains a staunch ally.</p>
          <p>Well-Organized Wealth. Bronze dragons loot sunken ships and also collect colorful coral and pearls from the reefs and seabeds near their lairs. When a bronze dragon pledges to help an army wage war against tyranny, it asks for nominal payment. If such a request is beyond its allies' means, it might settle for a collection of old books on military history or a ceremonial item commemorating the alliance. A bronze dragon mightalso lay claim to a treasure held by the enemy that it feels would be safer under its protection.</p>
          <h>A Bronze Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>A bronze dragon lairs in coastal caves. It might salvage a wrecked ship, reconstruct it within the confines of its lair, and use it as a treasure vault or nest for its eggs.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragontakes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The dragon creates fog as though it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
            <li>A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within a 20-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) thunder damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary bronze dragon's lairis warped by the dragon's magic.</p>
          <list>
            <li>Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn't need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.</li>
            <li>Underwater plants within 6 miles of the dragon's lair take on dazzlingly brilliant hues.</li>
            <li>Within its lair, the dragon can set illusory sounds,such as soft music and strange echoes, so that they can be heard in various parts of the lair.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>
          <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Noble Curiosity.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p>
          <p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Solitary Shape shifters.</i>
            </b> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
          <p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away fromcivilization as possible so as to not attract enemies.However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>The Persistence of Memory.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>King of Good Dragons.</i>
            </b> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p>
          <p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>

          <p>Bronze dragons are coastal dwellers that feed primarily on aquatic plants and fish. They take the forms of friendly animals to observe other creatures of interest. They are also fascinated by warfare and eagerly join armies fighting for a just cause.</p>
          <p>A ribbed and fluted crest defines the shape of a bronze dragon's head. Curving horns extend out from the crest, echoed by spines on its lower jaw and chin. To help them swim, bronze dragons have webbed feet and smooth scales. A bronze wyrmling's scales are yellow tinged with green; only as the dragon approaches adulthood does its color deepen to a darker, rich bronze tone. The pupils of a bronze dragon's eyes fade as the dragon ages, until they resemble glowing green orbs.</p>

            <b>
              <i>Dragons of the Coast.</i>
            </b> Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the ship's captain for the item.</p>

            <b>
              <i>War Machines.</i>
            </b> Bronze dragons actively oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by putting their size and strength to good use.When a conflict unfolds near its lair, a bronze dragon ascertains the underlying cause, then offers its services to any side that fights for good. Once a bronze dragon commits to a cause, it remains a staunch ally.</p>
          <p>Well-Organized Wealth. Bronze dragons loot sunken ships and also collect colorful coral and pearls from the reefs and seabeds near their lairs. When a bronze dragon pledges to help an army wage war against tyranny, it asks for nominal payment. If such a request is beyond its allies' means, it might settle for a collection of old books on military history or a ceremonial item commemorating the alliance. A bronze dragon mightalso lay claim to a treasure held by the enemy that it feels would be safer under its protection.</p>
          <h>A Bronze Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>A bronze dragon lairs in coastal caves. It might salvage a wrecked ship, reconstruct it within the confines of its lair, and use it as a treasure vault or nest for its eggs.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragontakes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The dragon creates fog as though it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
            <li>A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within a 20-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) thunder damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary bronze dragon's lairis warped by the dragon's magic.</p>
          <list>
            <li>Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn't need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.</li>
            <li>Underwater plants within 6 miles of the dragon's lair take on dazzlingly brilliant hues.</li>
            <li>Within its lair, the dragon can set illusory sounds,such as soft music and strange echoes, so that they can be heard in various parts of the lair.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>
          <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Noble Curiosity.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p>
          <p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Solitary Shape shifters.</i>
            </b> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
          <p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away fromcivilization as possible so as to not attract enemies.However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>The Persistence of Memory.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>King of Good Dragons.</i>
            </b> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p>
          <p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>

            <desc type="string">Despite their gregarious and even-tempered natures, they possess a covetous, miserly streak, and can become dangerous when their hoards are threatened. A copper dragon has brow plates jutting over its eyes, extending back to long horns that grow as a series of overlapping segments. Its backswept cheek ridges and jaw frills give it a pensive look. At birth, a copper dragon's scales are a ruddy brown with a metallic tint. As the dragon ages, its scales become more coppery in color, later taking on a green tint as it ages. A copper dragon's pupils fade with age, and the eyes of the oldest copper dragons resemble glowing turquoise orbs. #bis;Good Hosts. A copper dragon appreciates wit, a good joke, humorous story, or riddle. A copper dragon becomes annoyed with any creature that doesn't laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor.</desc>

Metals and precious stones are favorites of these creatures.</desc>

            <name type="string">A copper dragon is wary when it comes to showing off its possessions</name>
            <desc type="string">If it knows that other creatures seek a specific item in its hoard, a copper dragon will not admit to possessing the item. Instead, it might send curious treasure hunters on a wild goose chase to search for the object while it watches from afar for its own pleasure. #h;A Copper Dragon's Lair Copper dragons dwell in dry uplands and on hilltops, where they make their lairs in narrow caves. False walls in the lair hide secret antechambers where the dragon stores valuable ores, art objects, and other oddities it has collected over its lifetime. Worthless items are put on display in open caves to tantalize treasure seekers and distract them from where the real treasure is hidden. Lair Actions On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects: #ls; #li;The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the spike growth spelland lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again oruntil the dragon dies. #li;The dragon chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become restrained. A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the restrained condition on a success. Moving 1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initia. tive count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free increases to 20. #le; #h;Regional Effects The region containing a legendary copper dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects: #ls; #li;Magic carvings of the dragon's smiling visage can be seen worked into stone terrain and objects within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. #li;Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are nor.mally unable to speak gain the magical ability tospeak and understand Draconic while within 1 mileof the dragon's lair. These creatures speak well of the dragon, but can't divulge its whereabouts. #li;Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the dragon's lairare prone to fits of giggling. Even serious matters sud.denly seem amusing. #le; If the dragon dies, the magic carvings fade over the course of 1d10 days. The other effects end immediately. #h;Metallic Dragons Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world. #bis;Noble Curiosity. Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</desc>

            <name type="string">A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good</name>
            <desc type="string">However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item. #bis;Solitary Shape shifters. At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</desc>

            <name type="string">Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away fromcivilization as possible so as to not attract enemies</name>
            <desc type="string">However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events. #bis;The Persistence of Memory. Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before. #bis;King of Good Dragons. The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form. Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</desc>

            <b>
              <i>Noble Curiosity.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p>
          <p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>

            </b> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>

            </b> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>

              <i>King of Good Dragons.</i>
            </b> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p>
          <p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>

          <h>Gold Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_golddragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Gold Dragon</link>
          <p>The most powerful and majestic of the metallic dragons, gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil.</p>
          <p>A gold dragon has a sagacious face anointed with flexible spines that resemble whiskers. Its horns sweep back from its nose and brow, echoing twin frills that adorn its long neck. A gold dragon's sail-like wings start at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting it fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming through the air. A gold dragon wyrmling has scales of dark yellow with metallic flecks. Those flecks grow larger as the dragon matures. As a gold dragon ages, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble pools of molten gold.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Devourer of Wealth.</i>
            </b> Gold dragons can eat just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn't need to gorge itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren't bribes.</p>
          <p>Reserved Shape shifters. Gold dragons are respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness, but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other dragons</p>
          <p>except their own mates and offspring.</p>
          <p>Older gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid forms. Rarely does a gold dragon in disguise reveal its true form. In the guise of a peddler, it might regularly visit a town to catch up on local gossip, patronize honest businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways. In the guise of an animal, the dragon might befriend a lost child, a wandering minstrel, or an innkeeper, serving asa companion for days or weeks on end.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Master Hoarders.</i>
            </b> A gold dragon keeps its hoard in a well-guarded vault deep within its lair. Magical wards placed on the vault make it all but impossible to remove any treasures without the dragon knowing about it.</p>
          <h>A Gold Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Gold dragons make their homes in out-of-the-way places, where they can do as they please without arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes  and rivers, mist-shrouded islands, cave complexes hidden behind sparkling waterfalls, or ancient ruins.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws untilinitiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
            <li>One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of existence the dragon has imagined into being. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the dragon's. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary gold dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its con.versation with the dragon upon waking.</li>
            <li>Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within6 miles of the dragon's lair. The mist doesn't obscure anything. It assumes haunting forms when evil crea.tures are near the dragon or other non-evil creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.</li>
            <li>Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the dragon's lair sparkle and gleam, shedding dim light in a5-foot radius.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, these effects end immediately.</p>
          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>
          <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p>

          <p>The most powerful and majestic of the metallic dragons, gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil.</p>
          <p>A gold dragon has a sagacious face anointed with flexible spines that resemble whiskers. Its horns sweep back from its nose and brow, echoing twin frills that adorn its long neck. A gold dragon's sail-like wings start at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting it fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming through the air. A gold dragon wyrmling has scales of dark yellow with metallic flecks. Those flecks grow larger as the dragon matures. As a gold dragon ages, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble pools of molten gold.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Devourer of Wealth.</i>
            </b> Gold dragons can eat just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn't need to gorge itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren't bribes.</p>
          <p>Reserved Shape shifters. Gold dragons are respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness, but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other dragons</p>
          <p>except their own mates and offspring.</p>
          <p>Older gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid forms. Rarely does a gold dragon in disguise reveal its true form. In the guise of a peddler, it might regularly visit a town to catch up on local gossip, patronize honest businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways. In the guise of an animal, the dragon might befriend a lost child, a wandering minstrel, or an innkeeper, serving asa companion for days or weeks on end.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Master Hoarders.</i>
            </b> A gold dragon keeps its hoard in a well-guarded vault deep within its lair. Magical wards placed on the vault make it all but impossible to remove any treasures without the dragon knowing about it.</p>
          <h>A Gold Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Gold dragons make their homes in out-of-the-way places, where they can do as they please without arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes  and rivers, mist-shrouded islands, cave complexes hidden behind sparkling waterfalls, or ancient ruins.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws untilinitiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
            <li>One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of existence the dragon has imagined into being. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the dragon's. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary gold dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its con.versation with the dragon upon waking.</li>
            <li>Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within6 miles of the dragon's lair. The mist doesn't obscure anything. It assumes haunting forms when evil crea.tures are near the dragon or other non-evil creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.</li>
            <li>Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the dragon's lair sparkle and gleam, shedding dim light in a5-foot radius.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, these effects end immediately.</p>
          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>
          <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Noble Curiosity.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p>
          <p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Solitary Shape shifters.</i>
            </b> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
          <p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away fromcivilization as possible so as to not attract enemies.However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>The Persistence of Memory.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>King of Good Dragons.</i>
            </b> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p>
          <p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>

          <h>Gold Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_golddragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Gold Dragon</link>
          <p>The most powerful and majestic of the metallic dragons, gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil.</p>
          <p>A gold dragon has a sagacious face anointed with flexible spines that resemble whiskers. Its horns sweep back from its nose and brow, echoing twin frills that adorn its long neck. A gold dragon's sail-like wings start at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting it fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming through the air. A gold dragon wyrmling has scales of dark yellow with metallic flecks. Those flecks grow larger as the dragon matures. As a gold dragon ages, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble pools of molten gold.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Devourer of Wealth.</i>
            </b> Gold dragons can eat just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn't need to gorge itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren't bribes.</p>
          <p>Reserved Shape shifters. Gold dragons are respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness, but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other dragons</p>
          <p>except their own mates and offspring.</p>
          <p>Older gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid forms. Rarely does a gold dragon in disguise reveal its true form. In the guise of a peddler, it might regularly visit a town to catch up on local gossip, patronize honest businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways. In the guise of an animal, the dragon might befriend a lost child, a wandering minstrel, or an innkeeper, serving asa companion for days or weeks on end.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Master Hoarders.</i>
            </b> A gold dragon keeps its hoard in a well-guarded vault deep within its lair. Magical wards placed on the vault make it all but impossible to remove any treasures without the dragon knowing about it.</p>
          <h>A Gold Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Gold dragons make their homes in out-of-the-way places, where they can do as they please without arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes  and rivers, mist-shrouded islands, cave complexes hidden behind sparkling waterfalls, or ancient ruins.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws untilinitiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
            <li>One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of existence the dragon has imagined into being. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the dragon's. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary gold dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its con.versation with the dragon upon waking.</li>
            <li>Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within6 miles of the dragon's lair. The mist doesn't obscure anything. It assumes haunting forms when evil crea.tures are near the dragon or other non-evil creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.</li>
            <li>Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the dragon's lair sparkle and gleam, shedding dim light in a5-foot radius.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, these effects end immediately.</p>
          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>
          <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Noble Curiosity.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p>
          <p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Solitary Shape shifters.</i>
            </b> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
          <p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies.However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>The Persistence of Memory.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>King of Good Dragons.</i>
            </b> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p>
          <p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>

          <h>Silver Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_silverdragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Silver Dragon</link>
          <p>The friendliest and most social of the metallic dragons, silver dragons cheerfully assist good creatures in need.</p>
          <p>A silver dragon shimmers as if sculpted from pure metal, its face given a noble cast by its high eyes and sweeping beard-like chin spikes. A spiny frill rises high over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip of its tail. A silver wyrmling's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dragons of Virtue.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons believe that livinga moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one's actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don't take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Friends of the Small Races.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong friendships.</p>
          <p>Silver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Respect for Humanity.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don't. Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find fascinating.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Hoarding History.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons love to possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen</p>
          <p>humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine jewellery crafted by numerous races. Other treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities.</p>
          <h>A Silver Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Silver dragons dwell among the clouds, making their lairs on secluded cold mountain peaks. Though many are comfortable in natural cavern complexes or abandoned mines, silver dragons covet the lost outposts of humanoid civilization. An abandoned mountaintopcitadel or a remote tower raised by a long-dead wizard is the sort of lair that every silver dragon dreams of.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The dragon creates fog as if it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
            <li>A blisteringly cold wind blows through the lair near the dragon. Each creature within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) cold damage. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary silver dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects.</p>

          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>
          <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Noble Curiosity.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p>
          <p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Solitary Shape shifters.</i>
            </b> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
          <p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies.However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>The Persistence of Memory.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>King of Good Dragons.</i>
            </b> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p>
          <p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>

          <h>Silver Dragon</h>
          <link class="imagewindow" recordname="reference.imagedata.img_silverdragon_jpg@DD MM Monster Pack - Dragons">Silver Dragon</link>
          <p>The friendliest and most social of the metallic dragons, silver dragons cheerfully assist good creatures in need.</p>
          <p>A silver dragon shimmers as if sculpted from pure metal, its face given a noble cast by its high eyes and sweeping beard-like chin spikes. A spiny frill rises high over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip of its tail. A silver wyrmling's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dragons of Virtue.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons believe that livinga moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one's actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don't take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Friends of the Small Races.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong friendships.</p>
          <p>Silver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Respect for Humanity.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don't. Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find fascinating.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Hoarding History.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons love to possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen</p>
          <p>humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine jewellery crafted by numerous races. Other treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities.</p>
          <h>A Silver Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Silver dragons dwell among the clouds, making their lairs on secluded cold mountain peaks. Though many are comfortable in natural cavern complexes or abandoned mines, silver dragons covet the lost outposts of humanoid civilization. An abandoned mountaintopcitadel or a remote tower raised by a long-dead wizard is the sort of lair that every silver dragon dreams of.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The dragon creates fog as if it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
            <li>A blisteringly cold wind blows through the lair near the dragon. Each creature within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) cold damage. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary silver dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects.</p>
          <list>
            <li>Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn't need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.</li>

          <p>The friendliest and most social of the metallic dragons, silver dragons cheerfully assist good creatures in need.</p>
          <p>A silver dragon shimmers as if sculpted from pure metal, its face given a noble cast by its high eyes and sweeping beard-like chin spikes. A spiny frill rises high over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip of its tail. A silver wyrmling's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Dragons of Virtue.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons believe that livinga moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one's actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don't take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Friends of the Small Races.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong friendships.</p>
          <p>Silver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Respect for Humanity.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don't. Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find fascinating.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Hoarding History.</i>
            </b> Silver dragons love to possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen</p>
          <p>humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine jewellery crafted by numerous races. Other treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities.</p>
          <h>A Silver Dragon's Lair</h>
          <p>Silver dragons dwell among the clouds, making their lairs on secluded cold mountain peaks. Though many are comfortable in natural cavern complexes or abandoned mines, silver dragons covet the lost outposts of humanoid civilization. An abandoned mountaintopcitadel or a remote tower raised by a long-dead wizard is the sort of lair that every silver dragon dreams of.</p>
          <h>Lair Actions</h>
          <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
          <list>
            <li>The dragon creates fog as if it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
            <li>A blisteringly cold wind blows through the lair near the dragon. Each creature within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) cold damage. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.</li>
          </list>
          <h>Regional Effects</h>
          <p>The region containing a legendary silver dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects.</p>
          <list>
            <li>Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn't need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.</li>
            <li>Within 1 mile of the lair, winds buoy non-evil creaturesthat fall due to no act of the dragon's or its allies. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.</li>
            <li>Given days or longer to work, the dragon can make clouds and fog within its lair as solid as stone, forming structures and other objects as it wishes. If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.</li>
          </list>
          <p>If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.</p>
          <h>Metallic Dragons</h>
          <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Noble Curiosity.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect,taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs.A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p>
          <p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Solitary Shape shifters.</i>
            </b> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
          <p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies.However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>The Persistence of Memory.</i>
            </b> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>King of Good Dragons.</i>
            </b> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p>
          <p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>

          <p>Dragon turtles are among the most fearsome creatures of the oceans. As large and voracious as the oldest of its land-based dragon kin, a dragon turtle strikes with its deadly jaws, steaming breath, and crushing tail.</p>
          <p>A dragon turtle's rough shell is the same dark green color as the deep water where this monster dwells. Silver highlights lining the shell resemble lightdancing on open water, and a surfacing dragon turtle is sometimes mistaken for the reflection of the sun or moon on the waves. Dragons of the Deep. Like true dragons, dragon turtles collect treasure, first by sinking ships and then by sifting through the wreckage for coins and other precious items. A dragon turtle swallows treasure for transport, then regurgitates it when it reaches its lair.</p>
          <p>Dragon turtles dwell in caves hidden in coral reefs or beneath the seafloor, or along rugged stretches of coastline. If a choice cave is already inhabited, a dragon turtle attacks its current residents in an attempt to take over.</p>

            <b>
              <i>Mercenary Monsters.</i>
            </b> A dragon turtle is smart enough to be bribed, and pirates sailing seas patrolled by these creatures quickly learn to offer them treasure in exchange for safe passage. Clever sahuagin sometimes ally with dragon turtles, enticing themwith treasure to use their blistering breath weapons in sahuagin raids against ships and coastal settlements.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Elemental Might.</i>
            </b> Dragon turtles sometimes find theirway through sunken planar rifts to the Elemental Planeof Water. Those monstrous specimens can often be found in the service of marids, which strap magnificent coral thrones to the backs of dragon turtles and ride them as mounts.</p>

          <p>The elusive pseudodragon dwells in the quiet places of the world, making its home in the hollows of trees and small caves. With its red-brown scales, horns, and a maw filled with sharp teeth, a pseudodragon resembles a tiny red dragon but its disposition is playful.</p>

            <b>
              <i>Quiet and Defensive.</i>
            </b> Pseudodragons have little interest in other creatures, and they avoid them whenever possible. If it is attacked, a pseudodragon fights back using the poisonous stinger at the tip of its tail, one jab of which can put a creature into a catatonic state that can last for hours.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Draconic Familiars.</i>
            </b> Mages often seek out pseudodragons, whose agreeable disposition, telepathic ability, and resistance to magic make them superior familiars. Pseudodragons are selective when it comes to choosing companions, but they can sometimes be won over with gifts of food or treasure. When a pseudodragon finds an agreeable companion, it bonds with that person as long as it is treated fairly.</p>
          <p>A pseudodragon puts up with no ill treatment, and it abandons a manipulative or abusive companion without warning.</p>

            <b>
              <i>Language of Emotion.</i>
            </b> Pseudodragons can't speak, but they communicate using a limited form of telepathy that allows them to share basic ideas such as hunger, curiosity, or affection. When it bonds with a companion, a pseudodragon can communicate what it sees and hears even over long distances.</p>
          <p>A pseudodragon often vocalizes animal noises. A rasping purr indicates pleasure, while a hiss means unpleasant surprise. A bird-like chirping represents desire, and a growl always means anger or discontent.</p>

          </p>
          <p>Some pseudodragons are willing to serve spellcasters as a familiar. Such pseudodragons have the following trait.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Familiar.</i>
            </b> The pseudodragon can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the pseudodragon senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the pseudodragon is within 10 feet of its companion, the companion shares the pseudodragon's Magic Resistance trait. At any time and for any reason, the pseudodragon can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.</p>

          <p>A wyvern has two scaly legs, leathery wings, and a sinewy tail topped with its most potent weapon: a poison stinger. The poison in a wyvern's stinger can kill a creature in seconds. Extremely potent, wyvern poison burns through its victim's bloodstream, disintegrating veins and arteries on its way to the heart. As deadly as wyverns can be, however, hunters and adventurers often track them to claim the venom, which is used in alchemical compounds and to coat weapons.</p>

If forced into a confrontation on the ground, a wyvern crouches low, keeping its stinger poised above its head as it hisses and growls.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Aggressive and Reckless.</i>
            </b> A wyvern intent on its prey backs down only if it sustains serious injury, or if its prey eludes it long enough for another easier potential meal to wander along. If it corners a fleeing creature in an enclosure too small to enter, a wyvern guards where the quarry hides, lashing with its stinger whenever opportunity allows.</p>
          <p>Although they possess more cunning than ordinary beasts, wyverns lack the intelligence of their draconic cousins. As such, creatures that maintain their composure as a wyvern hunts them from the air can often elude or trick it. Wyverns follow a direct path to their prey, with no thought given to possible ambushes.</p>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>Tamed Wyverns.</i>
            </b> A wyvern can be tamed for use as a mount, but doing so presents a difficult and deadly challenge. Raising one as a hatchling offers the best results. However, a wyvern's violent temperament has cost the life of many a would-be master.</p>

          <h>Introduction</h>
          <p>This bestiary is for storytellers and worldbuilders. If you have ever thought about running a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game for your friends, either a single night's adventure or a long-running campaign, this tome contains page after page of inspiration. It's your one-stop shop for creatures both malevolent and benign.</p>
          <p>Some of the creatures that inhabit the worlds of D&amp;D have origins rooted in real-world mythology and fantasy literature. Other creatures are D&amp;D originals. The monsters in this book have been culled from all previous editions of the game. Herein you'll discover classic critters such as the beholder and the displacer beast next to more recent creations such as the chuul and the twig blight. Common beasts mingle with the weird, the terrifying, and the ridiculous. In collecting monsters from the past, we've endeavored to reflect the multifaceted nature of the game, warts and all. D&amp;D monsters come in all shapes and sizes, with stories that not only thrill us but also make us smile.</p>
          <p>If you're an experienced Dungeon Master (DM), a few of the monster write-ups might surprise you, for we've gone into the <i>Monster Manuals</i> of yore and discovered some long-lost factoids. We've also added a few new twists. Naturally, you can do with these monsters what you will. Nothing we say here is intended to curtail your creativity. If the minotaurs in your world are shipbuilders and pirates, who are we to argue with you? It's your world, after all.</p>

          <h>How to Use This Book</h>
          <p>The best thing about being a DM is that you get to invent your own fantasy world and bring it to life, and nothing brings a D&amp;D world to life more than the creatures that inhabit it. You might read a monster's entry and be spurred to create an adventure revolving around it, or you might have an awesome idea for a dungeon and need just the right monsters to populate it. That's where the Monster Manual comes in handy.</p>
          <p>The <i>Monster Manual</i> is one of three books that form the foundation of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, the other two being the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>. The <i>Monster Manual</i>, like the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>, is a book for DMs. Use it to populate your D&amp;D adventures with pesky goblins, stinky troglodytes, savage orcs, mighty dragons, and a veritable horde of creepy crawlies.</p>
          <p>Guidelines for creating encounters with monsters can be found in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>. That book also contains wandering monster tables and other goodies to help you use the monsters in this book in interesting ways, as well as advice for modifying monsters and creating your own.</p>
          <p>If you've never run a D&amp;D adventure before, we recommend that you pick up the Dungeons &amp; Dragons <i>Starter Set,</i> which demonstrates how to take a bunch of monsters and build an exciting adventure around them.</p>

          <h>What Is a Monster?</h>
          <p>A monster is defined as any creature that can be interacted with and potentially fought and killed. Even something as harmless as a frog or as benevolent as a unicorn is a monster by this definition. The term also applies to humans, elves, dwarves, and other civilized folk who might be friends or rivals to the player characters. Most of the monsters that haunt the D&amp;D world, however, are threats that are meant to be stopped: rampaging demons, conniving devils, soul-sucking undead, summoned elementals-the list goes on.</p>
          <p>This book contains ready-to-play, easy-to-run monsters of all levels, and for nearly every climate and terrain imaginable. Whether your adventure takes place in a swamp, a dungeon, or the outer planes of existence, there are creatures in this book to populate that environment.</p>
          <h>Where Do Monsters Dwell?</h>
          <p>If you are new to the D&amp;D game, you might not be familiar with the weird and wondrous places where monsters can be found and fought.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Dungeons</b>
          </p>
          <p>When most people think of a dungeon, images of dark cells with iron bars and shackles spring to mind. In the D&amp;D game, the word "dungeon" takes on a broader meaning to include any enclosed, monster-infested location. Most dungeons are sprawling underground complexes. Here are a few other examples:</p>
          <list>
            <li>A ruined wizard's tower atop a lonely hill riddled with goblin-infested tunnels</li>
            <li>A pharaoh's pyramid filled with haunted crypts and secret treasure vaults</li>
            <li>A lost city in the jungle, overgrown with vines and overrun with demons and demon-worshiping cultists</li>
            <li>The icy tomb of a frost giant king</li>
            <li>A filthy, labyrinthine sewer system controlled by a gang of wererats</li>
          </list>
          <p>
            <b>The Underdark</b>
          </p>
          <p>There is no greater dungeon than the Underdark, the underworld beneath the surface world. It is a vast subterranean realm where monsters accustomed to darkness dwell. It is a place filled with lightless caverns connected by tunnels that wind ever downward. One could spend a lifetime (however brief!) exploring the Underdark and find such places as the following:</p>
          <list>
            <li>A mind flayer prison or asylum, filled with mindless thralls and raving lunatics</li>
            <li>A lost dwarven necropolis containing row after row of dusty tombs waiting to be plundered</li>
            <li>A fortified outpost bristling with armaments, guarding the way to a magnificent drow city</li>
            <li>A subterranean rift filled with giant fungi and ruled by a megalomaniacal beholder or mad fomorian king</li>
            <li>A chain of rocky islands on a vast, sunless sea that's home to aboleths and insane kuo-toa</li>
          </list>
          <p>
            <b>The Wilderness</b>
          </p>
          <p>Not all monsters lurk underground. Many of them inhabit deserts, mountains, swamps, canyons, forests, and other natural settings. The wilderness can be just as dangerous as any dungeon, particularly when there's nowhere to hide! Some wilderness locations are just as memorable as any dungeon:</p>
          <list>
            <li>A roc's nest made of shattered ship hulls, built atop a lonely mountain or rocky hill</li>
            <li>A vast arctic tundra that serves as a hunting ground for berserkers and yeti</li>
            <li>A primeval forest protected by treants or corrupted by demon-worshiping gnolls</li>
            <li>A fog-shrouded swamp haunted by lizardfolk that worship a vile black dragon</li>
            <li>A jungle island inhabited by dinosaurs and human tribal warriors</li>
          </list>
          <p>
            <b>Towns and Cities</b>
          </p>
          <p>Some of the best adventures unfold in the cradles of civilization. Urban settings afford adventurers the chance to rub shoulders with the rich and powerful, butt heads with the dregs of society, and peel back the veneer of civility to see the monstrous evil lurking beneath. Within a medieval town or city are places as deadly as any dungeon:</p>
          <list>
            <li>A clock tower that serves as a base for a guild of kenku rogues and assassins</li>
            <li>A slavers' den hidden in an orphanage run by a rakshasa disguised as the headmaster</li>
            <li>A wizard's academy rife with corruption and practitioners of the necromantic arts</li>
            <li>A noble's manor where rich, devil-worshiping cultists gather to perform sacrifices</li>
            <li>A temple, vault, or museum watched day and night by animated constructs</li>
          </list>
          <p>
            <b>Underwater</b>
          </p>
          <p>Not all adventures take place on land. This book casts light on several creatures that haunt the oceans of the world, from the devilish sahuagin to the peaceful aquatic elves who loathe them. Within this aquatic domain are many surprising adventure locations:</p>
          <list>
            <li>A graveyard of sunken ships haunted by sharks, aquatic ghouls, and angry ghosts</li>
            <li>A storm giant's coral castle, beautiful yet foreboding</li>
            <li>A lost city on the sea floor, encased in a magic bubble of air and ruled by a medusa queen</li>
            <li>A kraken's cave or bronze dragon's cavernous lair, filled with ancient treasures</li>
            <li>A sunken temple of Sekolah, evil god of the sahuagin</li>
          </list>
          <p>
            <b>The Planes of Existence</b>
          </p>
          <p>The Abyss. The Nine Hells. The City of Brass. Such faraway places beckon high-level adventurers to their doorsteps, defying the brave and the foolhardy to overthrow their evil masters and unlock their hidden mysteries. Many powerful, weird creatures live on other planes of existence, from orderly modrons to murderous demons. When it comes to interesting adventure locations, not even the sky is the limit when you pass beyond the boundaries of the world:</p>
          <list>
            <li>A pit fiend's stronghold on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells</li>
            <li>A haunted castle in the Shadowfell that serves as a shadow dragon's lair</li>
            <li>An elf queen's tomb in the Feywild</li>
            <li>A djinni's palace on the Elemental Plane of Air, filled with marvelous stolen treasures</li>
            <li>A lich's secret demiplane, where the undead archmage hides its phylactery and spellbook</li>
          </list>
          <p>See the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> for more information on the planes of existence.</p>
          <h>What Monsters to Use?</h>
          <p>Many monsters inhabit dungeons, while others live in deserts, forests, labyrinths, and other environments. Regardless of which environment a monster traditionally calls home, you can place it anywhere you want. After all, "fish out of water" stories are memorable, and sometimes it's fun to surprise players with gricks hiding under the desert sands or a dryad living in a giant mushroom in the Underdark.</p>

            <b>Modifying Creatures</b>
          </p>
          <p>Despite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a variant or template, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge rating.</p>
          <p>For advice on how to customize creatures and calculate their challenge ratings, see the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i>
          </p>
          <h>Size</h>
          <p>A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. See the Player's Handbook for more information on creature size and space.</p>

          </table>
          <h>Type</h>
          <p>A monster's type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an arrow of dragon slaying deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.</p>
          <p>The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Aberrations</b> are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature's alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Beasts</b> are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals. Celestials are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Constructs</b> are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Dragons</b> are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Elementals</b> are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Fey</b> are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Fiends</b> are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding.</p>
          <p>If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Giants</b> tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Humanoids</b> are the main peoples of the D&amp;D world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.</p>
          <p>A variety of humanoids appear throughout this book, but the races detailed in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>-with the exception of drow-are dealt with in appendix B.</p>
          <p>That appendix gives you a number of stat blocks that you can use to make various members of those races.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Monstrosities</b> are monsters in the strictest sense- frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don't fit into any other type.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Oozes</b> are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Plants</b> in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Undead</b> are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Tags</b>
          </p>
          <p>A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the <i>humanoid (orc)</i> type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.</p>
          <h>Alignment</h>
          <p>A monster's alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for descriptions of the different alignments.</p>
          <p>The alignment specified in a monster's stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster's alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there's nothing stopping you.</p>
          <p>Some creatures can have any alignment. In other words, you choose the monster's alignment. Some monster's alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.</p>
          <p>Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don't make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are unaligned, which means they don't have an alignment.</p>
          <h>Armor Class</h>
          <p>A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster's AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.</p>
          <h>Hit Points</h>
          <p>A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the <i>Player's Handbook.</i>
          </p>
          <p>A monster's hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 x- 4 1/2).</p>
          <p>A monster's size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Hit Dice by Size</b>
          </p>

              <td>10 1/2</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>A monster's Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 h it points (average 11).</p>
          <h>Speed</h>
          <p>A monster's speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the <i>Player's Handbook.</i>
          </p>
          <p>All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster's speed. Creatures that have no form of groundbased locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.</p>
          <p>Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Burrow</b>
          </p>
          <p>A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can't burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Climb</b>
          </p>
          <p>A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn't need to spend extra movement to climb.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Fly</b>
          </p>
          <p>A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to hover, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Swim</b>
          </p>
          <p>A monster that has a swimming speed doesn't need to spend extra movement to swim.</p>
          <h>Ability Scores</h>
          <p>Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they're used in play, see the <i>Player's Handbook.</i>
          </p>
          <h>Saving Throws</h>
          <p>The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn't easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don't have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.</p>
          <p>A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster's challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).</p>

          <h>Skills</h>
          <p>The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p>
          <p>A skill bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster's challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.</p>
          <h>Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities</h>
          <p>Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Additionally, some creatures are immune to certain conditions. If a monster is immune to a game effect that isn't considered damage or a condition, it has a special trait.</p>
          <h>Senses</h>
          <p>The Senses entry notes a monster's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Blindsight</b>
          </p>
          <p>A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.</p>
          <p>If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Darkvision</b>
          </p>
          <p>A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Tremorsense</b>
          </p>
          <p>A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Truesight</b>
          </p>
          <p>A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.</p>
          <h>Languages</h>
          <p>The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can't speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A "-" indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Telepathy</b>
          </p>
          <p>Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can't initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.</p>
          <p>A telepathic monster doesn't need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can't initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.</p>
          <p>A creature within the area of an antimagic field or in</p>
          <p>any other location where magic doesn't function can't</p>
          <p>send or receive telepathic messages.</p>
          <h>Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies</h>
          <p>Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.</p>
          <p>For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.</p>
          <p>See the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for rules on using armor or weapons without proficiency.</p>
          <h>Challenge</h>
          <p>A monster's challenge rating tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.</p>
          <p>Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1.</p>
          <p>Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.</p>
          <p>Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.</p>
          <h>Experience Points</h>
          <p>The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the DM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.</p>
          <p>Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.</p>
          <p>The Dungeon Master's Guide explains how to create encounters using XP budgets, as well as how to adjust an encounter's difficulty.</p>

          <h>Special Traits</h>
          <p>Special traits (which appear after a monster's challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Innate Spellcasting</b>
          </p>
          <p>A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can't be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster's challenge rating.</p>
          <p>An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the levitate spell, but the spell has a "self only" restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.</p>
          <p>A monster's innate spells can't be swapped out with other spells. If a monster's innate spells don't require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Spellcasting</b>
          </p>
          <p>A monster with the Spellcasting class feature has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher (as explained in the Player's Handbook). The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.</p>
          <p>The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a particular class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid.</p>
          <p>A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level lightning bolt spell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level spell slots.</p>
          <p>You can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on a monster's spell list with a different spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Psionics</b>
          </p>
          <p>A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn't require any components to cast its spells.</p>
          <h>Actions</h>
          <p>When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the <i>Player's Handbook.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Melee and Ranged Attacks</b>
          </p>
          <p>The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the "weapon" might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks, see the <i>Player's Handbook.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Creature vs.</b> Target. The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a "target" can be a creature or an object.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Hit.</b> Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the "Hit" notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Miss.</b> If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the "Miss:" notation.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Multiattack</b>
          </p>
          <p>A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack ability. A creature can't use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Ammunition</b>
          </p>
          <p>A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.</p>
          <h>Reactions</h>
          <p>If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.</p>
          <h>Limited Usage</h>
          <p>Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.</p>
          <p>
            <b>X/Day.</b> The notation "X/Day" means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses.</p>
          <p>For example, 1/Day" means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Recharge X-Y.</b> The notation "Recharge X-Y" means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster's turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.</p>
          <p>For example, "Recharge 5-6" means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster's turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.</b> This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.</p>
          <h>Equipment</h>
          <p>A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.</p>
          <p>You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, using the equipment chapter of the Player's Handbook for inspiration, and you decide how much of a monster's equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.</p>
          <p>If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.</p>
          <h>Legendary Creatures</h>
          <p>A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can't. Legendary creatures can take special actions outside their turns, and a few can exert power over their environment, causing extraordinary magical effects to occur in their vicinity.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Legendary Actions</b>
          </p>
          <p>A legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions-called legendary actions-outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. A legendary creature regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It isn't required to use its legendary actions, and it can't use legendary actions while incapacitated.</p>
          <p>
            <b>A Legendary Creature's Lair</b>
          </p>
          <p>A legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Not all legendary creatures have lairs. This section only applies to legendary creatures that spend a great deal of time in their lairs and are most likely to be encountered there.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Lair Actions</b>
          </p>
          <p>If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), the creature can use one of its lair action options, or forgo using any of them that round.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Regional Effects</b>
          </p>
          <p>The mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.</p>

                  <name type="string">What Is a Monster?</name>
                  <keywords type="string">What Is a Monster A monster is defined as any creature that can be interacted with and potentially fought and killed Even something as harmless as a frog or as benevolent as a unicorn is a monster by this definition The term also applies to humans elves dwarves and other civilized folk who might be friends or rivals to the player characters Most of the monsters that haunt the DD world however are threats that are meant to be stopped rampaging demons conniving devils soulsucking undead summoned elementalsthe list goes on This book contains readytoplay easytorun monsters of all levels and for nearly every climate and terrain imaginable Whether your adventure takes place in a swamp a dungeon or the outer planes of existence there are creatures in this book to populate that environment Where Do Monsters Dwell If you are new to the DD game you might not be familiar with the weird and wondrous places where monsters can be found and fought Dungeons When most people think of a dungeon images of dark cells with iron bars and shackles spring to mind In the DD game the word dungeon takes on a broader meaning to include any enclosed monsterinfested location Most dungeons are sprawling underground complexes Here are a few other examples  A ruined wizards tower atop a lonely hill riddled with goblininfested tunnels A pharaohs pyramid filled with haunted crypts and secret treasure vaults A lost city in the jungle overgrown with vines and overrun with demons and demonworshiping cultists The icy tomb of a frost giant king A filthy labyrinthine sewer system controlled by a gang of wererats  The Underdark There is no greater dungeon than the Underdark the underworld beneath the surface world It is a vast subterranean realm where monsters accustomed to darkness dwell It is a place filled with lightless caverns connected by tunnels that wind ever downward One could spend a lifetime however brief exploring the Underdark and find such places as the following  A mind flayer prison or asylum filled with mindless thralls and raving lunatics A lost dwarven necropolis containing row after row of dusty tombs waiting to be plundered A fortified outpost bristling with armaments guarding the way to a magnificent drow city A subterranean rift filled with giant fungi and ruled by a megalomaniacal beholder or mad fomorian king A chain of rocky islands on a vast sunless sea thats home to aboleths and insane kuotoa  The Wilderness Not all monsters lurk underground Many of them inhabit deserts mountains swamps canyons forests and other natural settings The wilderness can be just as dangerous as any dungeon particularly when theres nowhere to hide Some wilderness locations are just as memorable as any dungeon  A rocs nest made of shattered ship hulls built atop a lonely mountain or rocky hill A vast arctic tundra that serves as a hunting ground for berserkers and yeti A primeval forest protected by treants or corrupted by demonworshiping gnolls A fogshrouded swamp haunted by lizardfolk that worship a vile black dragon A jungle island inhabited by dinosaurs and human tribal warriors  Towns and Cities Some of the best adventures unfold in the cradles of civilization Urban settings afford adventurers the chance to rub shoulders with the rich and powerful butt heads with the dregs of society and peel back the veneer of civility to see the monstrous evil lurking beneath Within a medieval town or city are places as deadly as any dungeon  A clock tower that serves as a base for a guild of kenku rogues and assassins A slavers den hidden in an orphanage run by a rakshasa disguised as the headmaster A wizards academy rife with corruption and practitioners of the necromantic arts A nobles manor where rich devilworshiping cultists gather to perform sacrifices A temple vault or museum watched day and night by animated constructs  Underwater Not all adventures take place on land This book casts light on several creatures that haunt the oceans of the world from the devilish sahuagin to the peaceful aquatic elves who loathe them Within this aquatic domain are many surprising adventure locations  A graveyard of sunken ships haunted by sharks aquatic ghouls and angry ghosts A storm giants coral castle beautiful yet foreboding A lost city on the sea floor encased in a magic bubble of air and ruled by a medusa queen A krakens cave or bronze dragons cavernous lair filled with ancient treasures A sunken temple of Sekolah evil god of the sahuagin  The Planes of Existence The Abyss The Nine Hells The City of Brass Such faraway places beckon highlevel adventurers to their doorsteps defying the brave and the foolhardy to overthrow their evil masters and unlock their hidden mysteries Many powerful weird creatures live on other planes of existence from orderly modrons to murderous demons When it comes to interesting adventure locations not even the sky is the limit when you pass beyond the boundaries of the world  A pit fiends stronghold on Avernus the first layer of the Nine Hells A haunted castle in the Shadowfell that serves as a shadow dragons lair An elf queens tomb in the Feywild A djinnis palace on the Elemental Plane of Air filled with marvelous stolen treasures A lichs secret demiplane where the undead archmage hides its phylactery and spellbook  See the iDungeon Masters Guidei for more information on the planes of existence What Monsters to Use Many monsters inhabit dungeons while others live in deserts forests labyrinths and other environments Regardless of which environment a monster traditionally calls home you can place it anywhere you want After all fish out of water stories are memorable and sometimes its fun to surprise players with gricks hiding under the desert sands or a dryad living in a giant mushroom in the Underdark</keywords>

                  <keywords type="string">Statistics A monsters statistics sometimes referred to as its stat block provide the essential information that you need to run the monster Modifying Creatures Despite the versatile collection of monsters in this book you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of an adventure Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it into something more useful for you perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a variant or template such as the ones in this book Keep in mind that modifying a monster including when you apply a template to it might change its challenge rating For advice on how to customize creatures and calculate their challenge ratings see the iDungeon Masters Guidei Size A monster can be Tiny Small Medium Large Huge or Gargantuan The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat See the Players Handbook for

effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type For example an arrow of dragon slaying deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type such as dragon turtles and wyverns The game includes the following monster types which have no rules of their own Aberrations are utterly alien beings Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creatures alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world The quintessential aberrations are aboleths beholders mind flayers and slaadi Beasts are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology Some of them have magical powers but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals dinosaurs and giant versions of animals Celestials are creatures native to the Upper Planes Many of them are the servants of deities employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes Celestials are good by nature so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity Celestials include angels couatls and pegasi Constructs are made not born Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought Golems are the iconic constructs Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus such as modrons are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures Dragons are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power True dragons including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons are highly intelligent and have innate magic Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons but less powerful less intelligent and less magical such as wyverns and pseudodragons Elementals are creatures native to the elemental planes Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements including the creatures simply called elementals Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy The races of genies including djinn and efreet form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes Other elemental creatures include azers invisible stalkers and water weirds Fey are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests In some worlds they are closely tied to the Feywild also called the Plane of Faerie Some are also found in the Outer Planes particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands Fey include dryads pixies and satyrs Fiends are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes A few are the servants of deities but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding If an evil celestial is a rarity a good fiend is almost inconceivable Fiends include demons devils hell hounds rakshasas and yugoloths Giants tower over humans and their kind They are humanlike in shape though some have multiple heads ettins or deformities fomorians The six varieties of true giant are hill giants stone giants frost giants fire giants cloud giants and storm giants Besides these creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants Humanoids are the main peoples of the DD world both civilized and savage including humans and a tremendous variety of other species They have language and culture few if any innate magical abilities though most humanoids can learn spellcasting and a bipedal form The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters humans dwarves elves and halflings Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal and almost uniformly evil are the races of goblinoids goblins hobgoblins and bugbears orcs gnolls lizardfolk and kobolds A variety of humanoids appear throughout this book but the races detailed in the iPlayers Handbookiwith the exception of droware dealt with in appendix B That appendix gives you a number of stat blocks that you can use to make various members of those races Monstrosities are monsters in the strictest sense frightening creatures that are not ordinary not truly natural and almost never benign Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry such as owlbears and others are the product of terrible curses including minotaurs and yuanti They defy categorization and in some sense serve as a catchall category for creatures that dont fit into any other type Oozes are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape They are mostly subterranean dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse carrion or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes Plants in this context are vegetable creatures not ordinary flora Most of them are ambulatory and some are carnivorous The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category Undead are onceliving creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse Undead include walking corpses such as vampires and zombies as well as bodiless spirits such as ghosts and specters Tags A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type in parentheses For example an orc has the ihumanoid orci type The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures The tags have no rules of their own but something in the game such as a magic item might refer to them For instance a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag Alignment A monsters alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation For example a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate See the iPlayers Handbooki for descriptions of the different alignments The alignment specified in a monsters stat block is the default Feel free to depart from it and change a monsters alignment to suit the needs of your campaign If you want a goodaligned green dragon or an evil storm giant theres nothing stopping you Some creatures can have any alignment In other words you choose the monsters alignment Some monsters alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law chaos good or evil For example a berserker can be any chaotic alignment chaotic good chaotic neutral or chaotic evil as befits its wild nature Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos good or evil They dont make moral or ethical choices but rather act on instinct These creatures are unaligned which means they dont have an alignment Armor Class A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class AC that takes its armor shield and Dexterity into account Otherwise a monsters AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor if any If a monster has natural armor wears armor or carries a shield this is noted in parentheses after its AC value Hit Points A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points For more on hit points see the iPlayers Handbooki A monsters hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number For example a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average 2 u00C3 4 12 A monsters size determines the die used to calculate its hit points as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table Hit Dice by Size  Monster SizeHit DieAverage HP per Die Tinyd42u00BD Smalld63u00BD Mediumd84u00BD Larged105u00BD Huged126u00BD Gargantuand2010u00BD  A monsters Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses and the result is added to its hit points For example if a monster has a Constitution of 12 1 modifier and 2d8 Hit Dice it has 2d8  2 h it points average 11 Speed A monsters speed tells you how far it can move on its turn For more information on speed see the iPlayers Handbooki All creatures have a walking speed simply called the monsters speed Creatures that have no form of groundbased locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes Burrow A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand earth mud or ice A monster cant burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so Climb A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces The monster doesnt need to spend extra movement to climb Fly A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly Some monsters have the ability to hover which makes them hard to knock out of the air as explained in the rules on flying in the iPlayers Handbooki Such a monster stops hovering when it dies Swim A monster that has a swimming speed doesnt need to spend extra movement to swim Ability Scores Every monster has six ability scores Strength Dexterity Constitution Intelligence Wisdom and Charisma and corresponding modifiers For more information on ability scores and how theyre used in play see the iPlayers Handbooki Saving Throws The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects For example a creature that isnt easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws Most creatures dont have special saving throw bonuses in which case this section is absent A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monsters relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus which is determined by the monsters challenge rating as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating  ChallengeProficiency Bonus 02 182 142 122 12 22 32 42 53 63 73 83 94 104 114 124 135 145 155 165 176 186 196 206 217 227 237 247 258 268 278 288 299 309  Skills The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills For example a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom Perception and Dexterity Stealth checks A skill bonus is the sum of a monsters relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus which is determined by the monsters challenge rating as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table Other modifiers might apply For instance a monster might have a largerthanexpected bonus usually double its proficiency bonus to account for its heightened expertise Vulnerabilities Resistances and Immunities Some creatures have vulnerability resistance or immunity to certain types of damage Additionally some creatures are immune to certain conditions If a monster is immune to a game effect that isnt considered damage or a condition it has a special trait Senses The Senses entry notes a monsters passive Wisdom Perception score as well as any special senses the monster might have Special senses are described below Blindsight A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight within a specific radius Creatures without eyes such as grimlocks and gray oozes typically have this special sense as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses such as bats and true dragons If a monster is naturally blind it has a parenthetical note to this effect indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception Darkvision A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light The monster cant discern color in darkness only shades of gray Many creatures that live underground have this special sense Tremorsense A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance Tremorsense cant be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures Many burrowing creatures such as ankhegs and umber hulks have this special sense Truesight A monster with truesight can out to a specific range see in normal and magical darkness see invisible creatures and objects automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic Furthermore the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range Languages The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order Sometimes a monster can understand a language but cant speak it and this is noted in its entry A  indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language Telepathy Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range The contacted creature doesnt need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it but it must be able to understand at least one language A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but cant initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation A telepathic monster doesnt need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action but while the monster is incapacitated it cant initiate telepathic contact and any current contact is terminated A creature within the area of an antimagic field or in any other location where magic doesnt function cant send or receive telepathic messages Armor Weapon and Tool Proficiencies Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor weapons and tools If you swap them out you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment For example a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead and assume the giant is proficient with both one or the other or neither See the iPlayers Handbooki for rules on using armor or weapons without proficiency Challenge A monsters challenge rating tells you how great a threat the monster is An appropriately equipped and wellrested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths For example a party of four 3rdlevel characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge but not a deadly one Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1stlevel characters have a challenge rating lower than 1 Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20thlevel party can handle These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill Experience Points The number of experience points XP a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating Typically XP is awarded for defeating the monster although the DM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner Unless something tells you otherwise a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block The Dungeon Masters Guide explains how to create encounters using XP budgets as well as how to adjust an encounters difficulty Experience Points by Challenge Rating  ChallengeXP 00 or 10 1825 1450 12100 1200 2450 3700 41100 51800 62300 72900 83900 95000 105900 117200 128400 1310000 1411500 1513000 1615000 1718000 1820000 1922000 2025000 2133000 2241000 2350000 2462000 2575000 2690000 27105000 28120000 29135000 30155000  Special Traits Special traits which appear after a monsters challenge rating but before any actions or reactions are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation Innate Spellcasting A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait Unless noted otherwise an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and cant be cast at a higher level If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given use the monsters challenge rating An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions For example a drow mage can innately cast the levitate spell but the spell has a self only restriction which means that the spell affects only the drow mage A monsters innate spells cant be swapped out with other spells If a monsters innate spells dont require attack rolls no attack bonus is given for them Spellcasting A monster with the Spellcasting class feature has a spellcaster level and spell slots which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher as explained in the Players Handbook The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a particular class The list might also include spells from a feature in that class such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so For example a drow mage with the 3rdlevel lightning bolt spell can cast it as a 5thlevel spell by using one of its 5thlevel spell slots You can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared replacing any spell on a monsters spell list with a different spell of the same level and from the same class list If you do so you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating Psionics A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait This tag carries no special rules of its own but other parts of the game might refer to it A monster that has this tag typically doesnt require any components to cast its spells Actions When a monster takes its action it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures such as the Dash or Hide action as described in the iPlayers Handbooki Melee and Ranged Attacks The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks where the weapon might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon such as a claw or tail spike For more information on different kinds of attacks see the iPlayers Handbooki Creature vs Target The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target the difference being that a target can be a creature or an object Hit Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the Hit notation You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage for this reason both the average damage and the die expression are presented Miss If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss that information is presented after the Miss notation Multiattack A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack ability A creature cant use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack which must be a single melee attack Ammunition A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow Reactions If a monster can do something special with its reaction that information is contained here If a creature has no special reaction this section is absent Limited Usage Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used bXDayb The notation XDay means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses For example 1Day means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again Recharge XY The notation Recharge XY means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat At the start of each of the monsters turns roll a d6 If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation the monster regains the use of the special ability The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest For example Recharge 56 means a monster can use the special ability once Then at the start of the monsters turn it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6 Recharge after a Short or Long Rest This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again Equipment A stat block rarely refers to equipment other than armor or weapons used by a monster A creature that customarily wears clothes such as a humanoid is assumed to be dressed appropriately You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like using the equipment chapter of the Players Handbook for inspiration and you decide how much of a monsters equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else for instance If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block Legendary Creatures A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures cant Legendary creatures can take special actions outside their turns and a few can exert power over their environment causing extraordinary magical effects to occur in their vicinity Legendary Actions A legendary creature can take a certain number of special actionscalled legendary actionsoutside its turn Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn A legendary creature regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn It isnt required to use its legendary actions and it cant use legendary actions while incapacitated A Legendary Creatures Lair A legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there either by act of will or simply by being present Not all legendary creatures have lairs This section only applies to legendary creatures that spend a great deal of time in their lairs and are most likely to be encountered there Lair Actions If a legendary creature has lair actions it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair On initiative count 20 losing all initiative ties the creature can use one of its lair action options or forgo using any of them that round Regional Effects The mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment as noted in this section Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies</keywords>
