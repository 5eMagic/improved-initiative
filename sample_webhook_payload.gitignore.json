I built <a href=\"https://www.improved-initiative.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Improved Initiative</a>, a <strong>D&amp;D 5th Edition combat tracker</strong>.<br><br>\nImproved Initiative is a free web app for use at your in-person D&amp;D game. It doesn't get between you and your players, by offering an easy way to manage \n<strong>initiative order</strong> and <strong>hit points</strong>. It also shows you <strong>stat blocks</strong> right when you need them, and comes ready-to-use with all official <a href=\"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd\" target=\"_blank\">OGL</a> creatures from D&amp;D!<br><br>\nYour pledge helps pay for server costs and maintenance for Improved Initiative. In return, you'll get useful features like <strong>Account Sync</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/improvedinitiative/posts?tag=epic%20initiative\"><strong>Epic Initiative</strong></a>. Thanks to all of the patrons who support Improved Initiative!<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.improved-initiative.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Try Improved Initiative right now. It's free!</a></div><a href=\"http://www.improved-initiative.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><br></a><a href=\"http://www.improved-initiative.com/\" target=\"_blank\"></a><strong>How do I use the app?<br></strong>It's so easy! A tutorial will show you how to get started. There are many features that you can discover by exploring the settings menus.<br><br><strong>Is it really free?<br></strong>All the basic functionality of Improved Initiative will always be free. You'll never have to create an account to build and run encounters. Some features with extra server overhead, such as <strong>Account Sync</strong>, are granted to our <strong>Patreon </strong>supporters and <strong>Github </strong>contributors. The software is also free as in freedom- you can check out the source code and <a href=\"https://github.com/cynicaloptimist/improved-initiative\" target=\"_blank\">contribute on Github</a>.<br><br><strong>Can I suggest a new feature?<br></strong>I'm always happy to see feature suggestions. Check out our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/improvedinitiative/community\">community board</a> to share your feedback. I periodically add new features to both the free app and Epic Initiative.<br><br><strong>How do I report a bug?<br></strong>The best way to report a bug is to open an issue <a href=\"https://github.com/cynicaloptimist/improved-initiative/issues\" target=\"_blank\">directly on Github</a>. If you don't want to create a Github account for that, feel free to <a href=\"mailto:improvedinitiativedev@gmail.com\">email me</a> the details directly.<br><br><strong>Why aren't all the D&amp;D monsters built in?<br></strong>Wizards of the Coast provides only the monsters in the D&amp;D Basic Rules under terms of the <a href=\"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd\" target=\"_blank\">Open Game License</a>. You can add other monsters by hand, or you can import your own DnDAppFile data files with statblocks.<div><strong></strong></div>",
